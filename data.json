However, many parents are prioritising quality time with their children. They are making efforts to pass on the moral values they themselves absorbed from books during their own childhoods.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, reading books encourages kids to learn a wide range of vocabulary and language structures. Whereas the adults give small lectures to their toddlers in a concept of stories, kids tend to learn new words to start communicating with the surroundings. For example, youngsters at the range of age from 4 to 6 inclined to use phrases that they had read in fairy-tales. As a result, the brain of juniors is absorbing new information via stories read by their parents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, reading fairy-tales from proper books affects the emotional intelligence of youth. As shown by recent articles, diving into the literature, emphasise and identify their own feelings towards the characters. In the case of teens at age of 15, reading the writings gives more emotions and reactions to the plot. In short, literacy consumption among offspring develop the interpersonal skills.'",

We can enjoy the actor or singer presenting their art-work directly. There is no edited scene or tuned vocal while they performed it in real time shows so we would see their talent. Then, watching the artist performance on-site could be a good appreciation for their works because peoples usually paid higher and put more effort to see their actions directly through live shows.

Personally, I partially agree on this statement. The supporting reasons will be examined throughout this essay.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several advantages to the government's high taxes. First of all, the amount of money received will be paid for services and the price of things. However, the cost of maintenance on huge infrastructures could become a deposit for many businesses. Secondly, If the owners of businesses add to in term of  the price of food or others, they possibly could decrease their tax deduction in various ways.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the disagreement with tax must spent higher than standardised prices brings about many negative effects. Fisrtly, It is obviously see that the people's income will be interrupted by their daily life. Futhermore, this action totally will impact the economic crisis as possible as it will, for instance, poor people might not buy the necessarity for themselves.

If the majority of people become vegetarians, a nation need to struggle less to become self-sufficient on food production. Moreover, such diets are easily accessible both for the poor and rich citizens.

Do you agree\r\n\r\nor disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The issue of technology's role in the teaching process has sparked a heated debate among many. It is widely argued that teachers may be replaced by machinery, but this notion is not without its critics. I am firmly of the belief that it is impossible to remove the teachers from the learning process due to a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that the personality of a teacher may be more important than curriculum itself. The teacher could inspire children by finding the unique key to everyone. Especially in primary school, kids need to learn through gamification and only human teachers can find the component that is able to catch an attention.\r\n\r\nSecondly, during the learning process, it is critically important to grow critical thinking in minds. Checking facts, doubts and questions are the tremendous component of teaching. Even modern artificial intelligence can not validate the information and prove the opinion without human beings. However, achievements due to technological progress may assist to teachers and increase their productivity. For example, I could imagine the future history lessons with videobooks instead of textbooks, but I hardly visualise the lesson without a teacher at all.\r\n\r\nOverall, despite the fact that technology may play a big role in modern casual life, from my perspective, it is irrelevant in schools. The teachers are irreplaceable in this area, but technology could help raise the speed of getting information and the amount of data we are working with.'",

On my standpoint, both some types of online games on phones and friends who are studying with them are interrupting, and there may be some key solutions which are affective to delay these problems.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are some reasons to increase the number of people who are not understanding lessons in the schools. To begin with such reasons, I believe that all people have their private phones to utilize or communicate with their parents or friends, but nowadays, many people tend to play games on their phones. Also many people are in a lesson, they always try to play games. In addition, some people think that lessons in their schools are very boring, and they always try to make lessons very interesting with classmates in their classes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in my perspective, there are some possible solutions for this problem. Firstly, nowadays, in some schools, teachers are trying to be banned the phones in classes. Secondly, teachers should set one-place system for all people in which system one table should been allocated for per student. In this strict system, there is not density from one student to another one.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are a lot of issues, but they will be solved effectively by the government with some possible solutions.'",

This essay will cover on both sides of the argument.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the physical activities are fundamental in maintaining good health, so exercising is beneficial to all.

For example, many adolescents tend to leave they schools at a young age as their parents cannot afford their expenses. Furthermore, learning without any cost can lead students to improve their family conditions by securing a decent a job.Lastly, everybody in the nation will have certain basic human manners which inturn will help the society in long run.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some members claim that education is only for those having good income levels. But,it cannot be denied that only a minority of people are interested in this as knowledge is the basic epitome of community since ages. For example, most community members are worried about the future of the nation and are assuming the consequences which can be faced in future due to not acquiring adequate education.Thus, the authority should treat everyone on the same scale and provide free educational facilities to all.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my opinion,I believe that world will be a better place to live, free from crimes if everybody is educated without spending a single penny of their owns.'",

I belive that it is essential to be paid more salary for senior positions as they are play a vital  role for business development. This essay will delve into my viewpoints with relevant illustrations.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, one of the obvious reasons to be paid high salary for senior positions is the resposibilities and risks of the position what they are holding into. In other words, senior positions  in companies have responsbility for sustaining the company in the high-competative business world. For example, top management is formulating business and marketing strategies, therefore, they should be highly efficient and alert about the market fluctuations. For example, the famous entertainment company BlockBluster bankrupted due to the ineffcientcy of the senior management.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, senior leaders have more personal expenses to run business compared to other employees. For example, they should wear expensive suits for business meetings and conferences which would not compensated by business establishments. Similarly, top managment people are the glamour faces of a business organisations, therfore, they should be paid more to attract more potential leaders to the organisation. Moreover, other employees in the oragnisation will be motivated  and they would work hard to achieve senior management positions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, senior management positions have more responsbilities and risk compared to ordinary employees. Ergo, I believe that they have to be paid more remuneration to motivate others to reach top positions.'",

While the perspectives vary widely among the two groups, I agree that both parties bear responsability for subpar food intake, as I would argue in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, a nutritious diet is often overlooked by consumers. This is because the majority of them prioritises the monetary aspect of food over nutrition and chooses cheap alternatives which are devoid of fundamental nutrients. These consumer's choices lead to obesity, diabetis or heart diseases, resulting in the low quality of lifestyle. Notably, the ratio of people choosing low-quality food covers a large segment of the adult population, as demonstrated by numerous studies.\r\n\r\nThe lack of adequate dietary choices is exagerbated by weak regolation oversigh. The manufacturers indeed fail to effectively communicate the amount of deleterious elements in foods and the deceptive labelling creates additional confusion among consumers. The excess of sugar or salt, used as preservatives in numerous foods, is often omitted from labelling; the same holds for fat and oils. The issue has created a controversial situation when, for example, several managerial personas have been arrested for fraud because of lack of transparency in their labelling system, which in turn created several cases of malnoutrition in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the lack of committment from consumers and the misleading labelling are jointly the major causes for malnoutrition among the adult population.

A school of thought holds that punishment should be similar for all criminals who perpetrate a major crime, no matter of age.

In other worlds, juvenile crimes do not fully develop awareness that lead to lack of knowledge about the consequence. Acordingly, it can be inferred that majority of youth muder perpetrate because of negative influence from family and friends. Consequently, it is possible to juvenile crimes to be rehabilitated and changed way of thinking.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that there is no gain saying that using rehalibitation programmes to renovate youth crimes has more possitive approach. To be more specigic, rehalibitation programmes have many way that can educate young criminals. These methods can help teenagers who commit a crime reintegrate to the community and boarden oppotunity to . For example, counselling, vocational training are some ways that can be utilized to rehalibitate these teenagers. As a result, juvenile crimes will have a potential future.\r\n\r\n   In view of the aforementioned arguments, my unshakable conviction is that juvenile offending who perpetrate a major crime should not receive as similar punishment as mature crime.'",

They can easily discuss with other countries on the global level to control and make the new strategies. For example, In the last decades, the administrations are more focused on an electric vehicle rather than petrol or diesel Vehicle and provided some subsides on that, so that people can easily buy.\r\n\r\nOn the other sides, the governments passed some rules related to the environment issues and asked to people follow these rules strictly. If they not follow this rule then set the high penalty cost.  The governments only make the rules but follow by people. For instance, the Indore City has won the first prize in India for first cleanness city from the last four years.

I really belive that buying a diesel engine or an electric one, should not be influencing by no one. \r\n\r\nOn the first hand, by forcing humans to buy only electric cars, the production of  electric car will go up, but in the same time, I personally think that people will stop buying that, as an answer for the big producers, as a prostest. If everyone will have an electric car, it will be a problem when is about to stock the others, so should be a balance. I belive that combine both engines, is the best idea the diesel or the gas engine, with the electric one. In this case people who wants the electric car will have one, and others who likes the termic engine, will have that too. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, producing hybrid vehicles, cold be an advantage between electric car producers and diesel car producers. If they will start produce togheter hybrid cars, they will make happy both sides and in the same time, no one will lose money, working togheter, both products will be still on the market using both engines to produce only one. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, everyone should decide for themself and if one side would like to use diesel car and the other one, electric automobiles, then no one could force them to buy only one, and I would like to say that somewhere in the middle, like the hybrid car, will be the best choise for both sides, having one car with both engines connected.'",

Discuss both views' \n 'Text': 'Watching television has become a hobby for today's generation which is thought harmful for children's development and some people believe it is beneficial for them. I discuss both views in the upcoming paragraphs and agree with former view.\r\n\r\nFirstly, people who argue that television is beneficial for children are considering that international programs encourage kids to work hard and grow worldwide because celebrities are casted by some channels who influence young generation to show their talents through media and become successful in life. To cite an example, in  India there are many shows which are seen by kids and they  work hard to reach on those stages and participate in them, consequently, they get selected and become popular Worldwide.\r\n\r\nSecondly, spending excessive amounts of time by watching television is not only stops children's cognitive growth but also waste their time in which they should be playing outdoor activities as well as doing socializing. For example, International survey has been conducted that 80% of children invest their time watching television instead of going outside to play with others, therefore, they face some health obstacles such as obesity as they do not do physical activity. As a result, they become introvert. Also,television does not encourage deep thinking and concentration.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, children can get benefits by watching television and become famous in their lives but investing a lot of time by watching television also halt their cognitive function and create various kinds of diseases.'",

It is very serious because senior citizens are liabilities. A country with a high percentage of elders is a weak country because most residents are useless. We have to take care of them in the rest of their lives. They usually die slowly, and the medical fees are costly. Most of the old people are not able to work. It means they can not contribute to the society. Many governments put a lot of money into health insurance and technologies for them to extend their lives. In my view, it is not worthy. However, scientists are researching on how to live longer. They invented more and more medicines. They found a great number of treatments. They did numerous experiments. I believe all of those hard working will cause a bad ending to our world. Developed countries such as Japan, United Kindom, United States, and so on are facing elderly issues. They are struggling with those difficulties. Still can not find the remedy. What can we do for it? I have no idea.

However, there are also others which opine, arguing that the nature of the offences committed should be taken into consideration as well. In this essay, I will delve into discussing both sides of this coin and provide my view.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, capital offences which encapsulates major offences such as murder and drug trafficking should be dealt with the worst punishments available. The reason it should be done this way so that it sets a stern tone to the public and anyone who is harbouring any thought is committing similar act. This will not only deter any further wrong doing of the same kind but also reassures everyone that the country do not tolerate these crimes. For instance, in my country, Singapore, even the slightest trace of drugs found on anyone will be a call for prison time or worst death penalty for drug smugglers. These strict penalties have made Singapore one of the most safe and secure countries in the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, it can be argued that certain situations can make even the most law abiding citizen astray. Those who committed heidous crimes could be in a bad place at a bad time and they have no choice but to perform those acts. For instance, a drug mule captured recently, was forced to deliver drug packages through ingestion from London to Singapore because his spouse was kidnapped by drug lord in his home country in Columbia. These set off global call to the Singapore judicial council to reconsider the capital punishment being given to him.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, all capital offences must be dealt with by fixed capital punishments such as life or death penalty for the sake of public safety and also acting as a part of deterrence for future crimes. However, I also encourage for all crimes to be thoroughly investigated as there are certainly instances where an innocent man is doing what he did not by choice but was being forced and the mastermind should be arrested and face the music instead.'",

If the children get involved in work sooner, they will be professional at a lower age due to gaining more experience in the workplace some of which may not exist in the academic world.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are distinctive attitudes about the age of the graduated students each of which has its positive and negative impacts.

For example, children in the kindergarten learn about language are more likely to make friends. Additionally, providing pupils with language course will help them to introduce and respect the diversity of cultures and traditions in the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others believe that language course must be delivered soon for pupils. It was due to they require maturity cognitive development before deeply learn about language. It is crucial for pupils to more focus on numeracy and literacy abilities during early year. Furthermore, delaying opportunity to learn language will provide more space for student to be mastered in native language. For example, elementary school students are more ready to learn a foreign language because they already had good understanding in native language.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe that student must learn about language in very beginning time, because it is important to adjust themselves in environment.

For instance, recently I saw one businessman who said that he would not trust anyone while he had one of the biggest arbitrage companies in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people should have good treats of character, especially, for their reputation. In my mind, it is the most important thing that person can ever have. Also, they can make more friends. In my mind, people often feel what a person is like from the inside. Likewise, the best treats of character are that people could have been reliable, honest and the person must be the man of his word.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is hardly to trust somebody so people need to be careful while telling some important information to others. In my mind, you can trust only your relatives.'",

With the nice appearance, people can gain the first impression in interviews so  that they get more attention and chance to be hired, and, if people do have money, loads of money, they don not have to worry about lacking of profits. With these states, people can involve in lots of work and jobs which require a huge advantages from these.

With out the hardwork and dedication, people can not have motivation to work on their trip to success, they can not even gain experience because they show no interest in what they are doing.

The young groups said that there are opening opportunities for people who want to work successfully as a super start.

For instance, some factories in Vietnam was denounced of using relationship and money for some young managers and lack of experiment to manage.\r\n\r\nConversely, some citizens try to work very hard for their job such as learn carefully about the work, have good attitude to gain an impress salary and turn into wealthy. This is an evidence that determination and bring people to the top of success. Additionally, people who devote a lots for a company can receive an award per year. For example, some companies give good treatment for good employment and the reward can gain about a half of the salary they get per month.

Especially in the way children spend their free time. And from my point of view, I believe that this situation bring more harm than good.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that with the exploration of technology our life become more and more convenient. For example, with the development of some social networking sites such as Facebooke, Instagram on Twitter we are able te contact and interact with each other easily. Moreover, through some application for study, student can study online at home instead of going to school, and increase their study productivity. However, new technologies still have bright site and dark site, especially in the way children spend their free time.Because children are not mature to have the self-control and know the way to use these technologies correctly. \r\n\r\nSecondly, many children now have tend to stay at home and be addicted to technologies instead of participating some outdoor activities. As a result, this situation had brought to children some troubles about physical and mental health. For example, without the exercise children become more and more vulnerable and get diseases easily. Moreover, with technologies,students have tend to depend on it. For instance, they use google or some artificial intelligence application to find out the answer instead of work by themselve, and lead to bad result of studying.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, new technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. However, for children who are not mature enough I believe it brings more harm than good. Therefore, it is necessary for parents and schools to take part in teaching and monitoring students as well as children to teach them how to use it effectively and take advantage of it.'",

Do you think it is important to protect animals? What can be done to deal with this problem?' \n 'Text': 'Irrefutably, forests have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives virtually all around the world. Considering this scenario, some people believe that deforestation and hunting should  permit the people, however others believe that,  it is  part of our society to keep alive our ecosystem. I completely  agree with the point that statement. This essay will examine the above-given argument about deforestation and illegal hunting before reaching any staunch conclusion.\r\n\r\nPredominantly, there are myriads of benefits of forests and animals. Initially, forests give us wood where we use it for house hold purposes. Another reason is that animal maintains ecosystem on the earth. For example, humans use wood to lit the fire and  cook  food, heat-up their houses in the winter season and manufacture  furniture for their uses,personally as-well-as commercially. Therefore, it is clearly evident that forests and animals are beneficial for our community.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, strict laws and public awareness. The Government must impose hard rules on cutting jungles and prohibit to kill animals. In addition, the administration should organise campaigns and explain to the people, about the dangers on the  enviromnet  and public. For instance, in India, there is strict regulation for everyone, ban imposed on cutt  jungles and kill animals, such as the  tiger. As a consequence, it is apparent that forests and animals are part of our generation as they are living with us millions of years.\r\n\r\nPutting in a nutshell, following the analysis of trees, they  give shelters and food to humankinds and animals. Further, it is clear that animal maintains ecosystem and forests keep our surroundings with full of oxygen. However, some time forests are spread on agriculture soil and animal damage farmers crops, but it is not major issue instead to kill someone and cut  trees, which may leads to the  global warming.'",

However, I partially agree with this statement because there are many other skills, feelings and thoughts required to accomplish our goals. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is well-known that ambition could help our motivation to remain intact daily and help us to stay focused on our targets, which is explained from psychological and biological sources owing to our flight or fight response being switched on. For example, a lot of neurotransmitters are released, such as dopamine and adrenaline. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are other attributes that are vital for achieving our dreams such as discipline, consistency, and hard work as well as opportunities should be leveraged.

In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and in the end, my individual position will be shown.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, solo motor activities are that some people believe have significant values. Obviously, when a human has to carry responsibilities for itself it is a more efficient way to reach success in a field like sport. For instance, athletes such as swimmers are not able to worry about others and there are no common aims with others. Furthermore, there may not come up with different positions, and as a result they can bring off their purposes. However, they are by themselves and they will not be given any support, since solo athletes do not have a union. Consequently, athletes' excellent achievements are able to decrease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, team sports may have  numerous  benefits, owing to the fact that when sportsmen face problems other members can share  their advice and motivate each other. Nevertheless, being in the group may delay relevance results, due to there being lots of opinions that ought to be paid attention \r\n\r\nIn my view, both of them can have their advantages, and at the same time disadvantages.

In my opinion, the two main reasonsof this negative trend are: their habit of most young adults since childhood with their parents or relatives, that as they get older, they should not expend too much money, and the other reason is the comfortable spot of spending leisure time.\r\n\r\n    One main reason why many youngsters spend their free time going shopping is due to their parents' habits. In metropolitan cities, shops and entertainment places like theaters and games zones are available in big malls, so they will choose a mall to visit with their family. The parents can shop, and their children can play at game zones. This habit will grow with age until youth, which will be detrimental to their future. Adolescents should save their money and not spend too much because it can be more beneficial for a reserve fund if something wrong happens unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n     The world has become sultrier than before due to global warming; consequently, many public places, like shopping centers or malls, should have some electronic tools, such as substantial air conditioners, to make visitors convenient. Therefore, youngsters really enjoy shopping for several hours, and if they do it frequently, it will become their habit. [My suggestion for this paragraph is to start emphasizing that shopping is negative.\r\n\r\n    To conclude, the shopping trend is negative for the younger generation, as a lousy tradition, because it is wasting time and money. It is better to do something beneficial in leisure time and prepare for their future.'",

Governments must invest this money in public services instead.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary epoch, it is observed that executives are spending alot of money in the arts, like music, dance and theatre. A part of society believe that this is wastage of precious currency of the nation because rulers should foucs more on the development of health care, schools and trasport amenities, along with this theatre might act as a wrong trajectory for the posterity growth, while skeptics do not agree on this. I wholeheartedly agree with this matrimonial. Thus, I will explicate the extrapolates for my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin the most predominant reason that the government should invest more in the public services.  If the administration will be place their investment arrow on schools, hospitals and trasportation facilities, this can help them to increase the overall GDP of their nation because the people who are leaving below the poverty line, they put relentless pressure on the economy as a result nations gross demostic product shows a downfall in the internaional market. For instance, on the basis of reports of 2019 6.7% of Indian population is living below poverty line. Therefore, the rulers can invest money to fulfil their basic necessities to alleviate poverty and improve their countries condition at global level, rather than wasting this money on faciltating arts like theatres.\r\n\r\nAnother major reason to support this view is that music and theatres might act as hindrance in the growth process of the generation because they may get attracted towards the television stars and this may put the pernicious effect on the academics of learners. A prime example for this is seen in Indian culture, peers ask money from their guardians for their tution fee, but they utilise that money for watching movies. This exacerbates their education level. Thus, government should not permote the art, instead they can spend money to bring pedagogical approach of teaching in schools to enchance the interest of learners in books. Thus, learning institutes can be a best allocation of governmental money.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the statements mentioned above, there are money fields that needs investment likes schools and hospitals. Hence, government should focus on these rather than art and this can help the rulers to improve their income as well.'",

By way of explaination, students which have high scores in exams can go to good university and when students graduate, they can get a wonderful job which give them much money. Moreover,we often listen to successful businessmen,how they started their careers which they do not admire,but ended up being so wealthy and relating this to their dedication and a lot of determination until they reach their passion.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, there are some who believe money is everything in life,it could make you famous and well known. In addition to being wealthy,being good looking also leads you to the same. Although it is somehow correct ,in my opinion, there is much less chance of this.In views of this,we rarely see a wealthy human who reaches their goal without being dedicated or whereas without working brutally before reaching this.Besides,being affluent without working will eventually lead to failure.For example,a businessman will never succeed only by being rich.\r\n\r\nTo sum up,everything mentioned and both views are all keys to reach what you want.But in my opinion,it is all about passion and dedication rather than being good looking without working hard to succeed.'",

To illustrate this point, take a number of renowned brands such as Dior and Chanel as a prime example where unusual products, as well as professional models are altered to meet the demands of customers all over the world. As a result, their products not only increase the popularity about high-fashioned consumption but also become an icon in commercial places. Besides, these companies would gain a profitable income which help them to promote and succeed in career.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that due to working hard and trying our best in a particular aim, people have a chance to achieve their goals and become more successful in life. This means that the more time and effort they spend on enriching knowledge, as well as characteristic, the more accomplishment they acquire. Besides, although stress-related problems are an integral part which could exist at any time to prevent people from their achievements, they would plan everything more carefully and keep working until success. For instance, gaining the 100% scholarship of Harvard University is a difficult goal for almost all the exchange students. However, if learners know how to make a suitable plan and have a sustainable determination, they could have an opportunity to attend to this college.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while money and physical appearance play an essential role in the way to success, it should be recognized that working hard and determination are more crucial to accomplish many important achievements.

While there may have some benefits for current society , this can contribute to having exact problems for the governments, I think.\r\n\r\n On the one hand, having lots of elderly people in our community which has not a wish to learn own history is maybe useful. It might be important to prevent the community from the loss of imagination about Marvels in history, whose heroism still provokes young generation to be the leader of their society. Another one is to maintain customs pass from the past until now as a result of saying historical events. There are unchanged traditions such as being respectful to ancestors in where old people live more.\r\n\r\n Inspite of the arguments above, this hard situation brings several problems to the government. Firstly, living more longer has a detrimental contribution to the rate of unemployment in most of countries, which comes at the expenses of increasing the expenditure of these provisions. Some european countries now are, for example, experiencing that the proportion of individuals who have lost their abilities to work on increase compared to having babies. They are facing precise difficulty related to the lack of work force. Moreover, the second issue is to being given money that the government can invest in  other more useful sectors such as education and military to develop the intelligence and safety of countries for people are in retirement. It is evident that dividing investment into this people category comes at a huge cost to countries budget. As an outcome, this condition can compose the government not to focus on other more primary fields anymore. These two examples can easily explain why this case has many dismerits more than merits.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, ageing population seems to have some important sides such as being aware of historical characters and protecting from losing customs for our generation, rising unemployed people degree and having reduction in countries budget can be underpinned as unresolved issues to the government.'",

Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Language is a part of individual cognitive development and this should be taught in school. However, there is a debate of what age ought to learn certain language. There are those who think that a language subject should  be taught as early as primary school because children are more receptive and adaptable at this stage compare to  grown up people. But there are  also those who opposed to this belief because the language course should be for adult students suggesting they are more well informed and conscious about what they are getting into.  I am convinced that studying foreign language should initiate at formative years.\r\n\r\n On one hand,  children who are  academically taught of a secondary language as early as gradeschools have more advantages than those who are just learning the foreign language  in later years. The reason for this is children would easily adapt and imitate the words they hear and see in repetition with having better enunciation and retention that is why when another language is introduce to them, there is higher possibility of developing bilingualism. Furthermore, kids are more obedient than adult. They do not have corrupted mind which are good for learning the language despite the existence of others subjects like math and sciences in their schools. So, the early the language is being taught the better the retention and the usage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  since almost adults are more mature in many ways especially in handling  time and surroundings, the study of the language should be started. There are language courses being offered in some universities that are suited for college students own schedules.  By this routine the students would be able to learn the lesson at their own paces without being bombarded with all other subjects. For example, a postgraduate student wants only to enroll on a Spanish language subject for a whole semester in which this give the student ample time to learn the lesson with concentration. In addition,  older students have way more experienced and interaction with different people thus learning language is much effective.\r\n\r\nIn summary,  those who are learning the language at formative years have better recollection than those who obtain in later years. In my own opinion, it is really advantage to have acquired foreign language at early age because  this help develop good speaking habit and become more natural native speaker.'",

What are the advantages and diadvantages of this ?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, an increasing number of people can work on multiple jobs and switch careers during their course of life. This work phenomenon has its own advantages and disadvantages, which will be further elaborated in the paragraphs below.\r\n\r\nHaving more than one job could be an opportunity for people to earn more and do better financially. As these days jobs are becoming more flexible, people can work at the office and do freelance project at the same time, this help people have an additional income and can better provide for their needs. With the flexibility of the jobs that we have right now, people not only can work multiple jobs but also change careers during their life. This could also be beneficial for people, because humans grow from time to time and change their interest. Therefore, changing careers could be a great opportunity for individuals to hone on their new interest and skills.\r\n\r\nHowever, this phenomenon can also have its own disadvantages. Since people now work multiple jobs, this could risk people to overextend themselves and fall into a cycle of burnout. For example, working on a corporate job itself already took physical and mental commitment, adding another work such as freelance projects means taking another commitment which can put a toll on the individual's physical and mental health. Another downside of this is, while people can switch careers several times during their life, this could hinder someone from being a specialist of something and make people more of generalist. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, the world needs specialists to solve many important problems and to be a specialist, one must commit to a certain career path for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working on more than one job and switching careers multiple times in life has its own benefits and drawbacks. By doing these, people can have more income and realise their interest. However on the other side, if not being careful enough, people can fall into a cycle of burnout and lack expertise in their work.'",

The first driving force behind  this problem is global warming. To explain, the earth 's climate is rapidly changing. As a result, heat occurs.\r\n\r\nFor example, over the last few years, in Africa such exposure causes various skin diseases. Certainly as a result of global climate change. Another important reason for this issues can be climate change. This is because direct sunlight. It is bad condition for ecology.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, despite the fact that global warming is a serious problem. There are some reliable solutions to it. The first viable solution to this problem is new breakthrough of scientests and the development of the satellite. For instance, to create a new artificial intelligence to sun. The main thing is to patch the azone layer. Another significant way by which this problem can be tackled is that a robot protecting the azone layer. As a result, layer thickness is estimated.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although global warming is a serious problem that is creating many negative effects it can be addressed with the solutions that have been mentioned above.

Hence, determination is better.\r\n\r\nTo begin, effortive and hard-working people become successful because they succeed in acknowledge things.

Take Steven Jobs as an example, he was determined to try, fail and try again although he rejected applying to Harvard University and started his own business in a hard-working way.\r\n\r\nTo continue, appearance and money only makes people dependent on the others. In explanation, individuals who succeed in life by beauty and finance without any academic knowledge or ability to earn money, they just depend on the other people and cannot be independent.

Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

It is debatable whether they choose to work in the same country where they got their degree or not. People are divided into two different sides of this issue, the one who think it is a must to work in the same country and the one who think it is their freedom to choose which country they want to work in. This essay will discuss both sides of the arguments and provide clear explanations why it is required for them to work in the same country. \r\n\r\nFirstly, they owe to the country where they pursue their degree, especially if they get a scholarship for that. For instance, governments who provide scholarships for medicine schools clearly want to escalate local health services quality by helping the potential doctor candidates in studying medicine. They have spend a lot of money in order to establish great doctors who will be expected to cure the other citizens who got sick. Therefore, it is a common sense that these doctors or professionals need to contribute back by working in that country. \r\n\r\nSecondly, they tend to learn knowledge that suit with that country characteristics. For example, engineers who learn civil engineering in a country who prone to earthquakes will tend to learn how to build strong buildings that safe from earthquakes. While engineers who study in a cold territory will be capable to build buildings that safe from winter storms. Consequently, the more suitable their knowledge with the country needs, the better and the more maximum they can utilize their skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that requiring professionals to stay and make use their understandings in the same place where they pursued them is a great policy. Furthermore, the benefits and positive effects both the country and the individuals will gain are much more.

Despite that condition; however, I agree that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, medical care improvements can result in the soaring price of bills. Since a remarkable amount of money have been invested to upgrade the quality of health care deliveries, it is acceptable if people are compelled to pay back in a higher amount. Take, for example, the increasing birth surgery bills that occur at Pondok Indah Hospital in the past few years is due to the decision to upgrade their operation tools as well as the facilities in patient's room for post-operation. Even though that phenomenon is inevitable, I still believe it is no longer important since the government already established health insurance to compensate those who cannot afford to pay for their hospital bills. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it causes people to have a higher life expectancy. Generally, the improvements that have been made can be utilised to take preventive actions to alleviate the risks from particular disease, which can make people receive advanced treatment before they are getting worse. For example, the novel cancer-detector equipment that is used by one of eminent hospital in America successfully make one of their citizens, Teressa, to quickly receive an early treatment for her conditions. As a result, the doctor stated that her chance to live has risen to 48%, since the cancer is detected earlier than it should, Therefore, I think the improvements in medical care will have significant impact on society because it heightens the likelihood to suffer from diseases that can be prevented earlier. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although the improvements in the clinical care resulting in the higher amount of bill that should be paid, I still think the benefits outweigh the earlier drawbacks since it can make people have live longevity by preventing the given symptoms of diseases earlier.'",

For instance, students planning to move to a certain country for higher studies might get benefit from learning that native language in advance. Thus, foreign language studies should start from secondary school only.\r\n\r\n     However, others think that children must be learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. A major factor, supporting their belief is that smaller kids are smart learners. For example, pre-school students accompanied by foreign nannies, often learn their second language very easily in comparison with teen-age group having similar company. Therefore, any non-native language could be smoothly learned at an early age.\r\n\r\n    Both views put forward valid points, but I strongly believe that children should start learning a foreign language as early as schooling begins. Early learning is faster and improves as the child develops speech milestones. So, children should learn foreign language since early school time.\r\n\r\n   To conclude, although some people think that learning a foreign language should be a part of secondary school education to select it as per requirement, I feel that it should start the moment a child gets into a school as younger kids learn new things easily.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is generally accepted that in the modern days internet has become a big important role in people's life. Some might argue that museums are no longer needed anymore because an online platforms are much easier to access through the information. This essay will demonstrates why both sources should still exist for the learners.\r\n\r\nThe internet platform in the present has become one of the best tools in human's life. The first initial reason is that social websites contain almost all information about things that happened in the world from past to present. Moreover, Ai has been involved as a helping tools in the online world which is very beneficial to the users, such as the users can type the questions to ask them, and they can do a quick research within 2 minutes with an accurate answers, which is very easy for people to get through the informations and knowledges. There are also some drawbacks to it, such as sometimes the users might recieve fake news, because of the unreliable sources from the spammers, which lead people to misunderstand.\r\n\r\nTurns to the details of the museum place, the first notable benefit is the kids will not going to get fake information because every story from the books were written by  real resources and popular authors, most of the books have been proven by  UNESCO before being taken in to the galleries. Furthermore, children will have an opportunity to learn be seeing the real objects and pictures, this is the best way to study with experiencing the physical objects. In contrast, the galleries contain a huge number of the information, which might be hard to find some art piece, whereas the internet can be straight through the things that they would like to study.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in both sources can be beneficial in different ways as the reasons mentioned above, but there are also some disadvantages in some points of view too, depending on the situation. As the suggestion, everyone should be careful  the researching information from social platforms, try to explore many different websites. Additionally, they can merge the knowledge from two places, to recheck the true story.'",

Some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can learn.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, although some people are earning uncountable money from their business, plenty of indviduals criticize the situation due to its harm in countries, others advocate that a few people should remain earning good money in their job. This essay will discuss both these point of views and argue in favour of the letter. \r\n\r\nOne the one hand, quite small of employees do compelling works in their job area.  Futhermore, As a result those individuals deserve impressive cash in the job by taking risks and significiant roles. Salary is a fundamental method for workers in order to proceed logically their career. Was the government lessened their salary, they would not be motivated so as to work in the office. For instance, in 2018 Spain government amended their rules about salaries in jobs. it was observed that a myriad of people dismissed their work. Moreover, does earning huge money contributes people's focus on their work, and it also promotes human's life quality. In this way criminal issues would have an downward trend around the country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, finance system of the country might be exposed by some individuals earning a lot of money. Besides, Governments could reduce their other contribution for the environment in order to provide a fund for employees deserving to earn good salary. For example, republic of Turkey was able to present their financial circumstance by benefitting from the method. Thus, countries tend to reduce significiant people's salary so as to provide locals beneficial opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, economy ministry in countries should lessen amount of salaries for spesific persons in order to navigate economic source of country to other part of things.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, developing salaries has an extremely disadvantages for citizens becouse of its burden on economy. However, this essay advocate that countries should amend their precedures on salaries to provide locals good opportunities.'",

Some people think it is a good development while others consider it harmful. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Food processing technology has improved the variety of foods available and their quality. A portion of society argues that it is a beneficial advancement while others contend that it has negative effects. Both of the viewpoints have their own rationale but I reckon that overall it has improved the eatables.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many improvements caused by the scientific advances in the edible items. At first, it has decreased the overall perishability of the eatable items. Many methods have been introduced to increase the shelf-life of the products. For instance, pasteurization has improved the dairy products. Nowadays, dairy can be stored for a longer period of time than the past. Consequently, it resulted in the sustainability of the agriculture. The overload of produce waste and production demands had caused numerous environmental damages in the past. Hence, the produce storage techniques and advancements in the food storage has lowered the burden on the fields. Now, the ecosystem is more sustainable than the bygone era.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the contenders think that the technology has adverse effects on the human well-being. One argument provided by such people is that a plethora of the food additives added to the perishable items to preserve them are dangerous to the human health. For instance, many studies suggest that preservatives have carcinogenic effects on the genetic material of the organisms.\r\n\r\nHence, they do not favour such kind of advances in the biochemical science and believe that it have damaged the well-being.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is crucial that the production and the storage of the agricultural produce becomes sustainable and reduce any environmental pressure. However, the worries of arguers about the harmful effects of the chemicals on the living organisms are concerning. In a nutshell, people have benefited from the advances in the science.'",

However, many individuals argue that, money can make human cheerful. I will shed light on my stance in the following essay. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, I wouldn't say money brings gladness and I would say it can dramatically increase the opportunity for citizens to be satisfied. For example, money allows nation stop worrying enough to enjoy life. I mean it lets others get more life experiences such as learning to ride a horse or diving in some Medxican caves. It also lets people take care of their health. For instance, go to the gym or swimming pool. \r\n\r\nOn the others hand, it is common belief that, residents labor long hours, day and night, and even when they are unwell. However, with great human ambition, money is never enough. Even if we work for decades and work hard, we still do not feel complete. To be honest, it is determined by individuals their needs and desires, their preception of the world in general and happiness in particular. Some citizens in my country feel cheerful with pets or spending time with family and friends. Moreover, these people are grateful for minor mercies and appreciate every moment of their lives.

For example, India is well known for its culture of unity in diversity, hence, most countries believe that India is open in terms of accepting new ideas. Furthermore, global image of any country is very significant factor in terms of maintaining relations with other countries. For instance, it is very easy for middle eastern countries to establish good relation with each other as they have similar cultures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some individuals opine that spending people\u2019s money on organizing art and cultural event has no direct benefits, and government should spend more on the development of education, health sector and other pressing problems.

I am partially agree with this phenomenon because old people are still prefer to read newspapers instead of reading the news on the screen.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, In this cut-throat competition individuals do not have enough time to sit and read the newspapers because everything is available on internet easily. For Instance, now a days social media spread the any type of news all over the world within a few seconds therefore people did not get the chance to read newspaper. Secondly, sometimes newspapers print irrelevant news rather than providing necessary information of the surrounding therefore it becomes bore for the readers, and they prefer internet to get the updates. Moreover, some people think that it is the extra expense for them to purchase newspapers as they are already paying for their mobile data therefore it can be the reason of declining the usage of newspapers.\r\n\r\non the other hand, older people believe that newspapers are best source to connect with the things that happened around the world. However, whenever they felt isolated they prefer to read the newspaper to spend their quality of time. Although, old aged people are not  that much efficient to use the modern technical gadgets as the young generation.

In this essay I will support my view with examples.\r\n\r\n A growing number of people believe that  criminals should be sent to jails regardless of the  seriousness of the crimes they commit  as punishment . Sentencing jail term to criminals shows justice not only for the victims but also for the community . There is common belief that criminals do not belong to community for safe and security reason. This is the reason that people still believe that prison is the best punishment for criminals.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view , prison is not the best place for punishment . In this modern world ,there are some alternatives to detain the felons . For instance , children under age of 18 should not be sent to main jail  together with others where  a great number of criminals stays and he or she can learn those bad habits and attitude from them . This will affect the physical and emotional development of children seriously . Shortly after he is released from the prison , he will not be able to behave like a decent one due to the experiences and influence of inmates from the prison . \r\n\r\nTherefore , the prison is not the best place for  those young children also known as minors .

Others say it is the resposibility of the consumers to avoid such products. Discuss and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The majority of people belive that store must slowly eliminate packaging for their products. While the other belive, those responsibility of buyers to avoid kind of stuff. In this forthcoming paragraph, I will discuss both issues and I will explain why i agree with the latter.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, sometimes if we go to groceries to buy something they will give a packaging for our stuff for free. They can be in myriad form, they can be plastic bags or recycle boxs. It makes us easier to bring them home. In the other hand, it also has disadvantages if they just provide non-recycled material packages. For instance, plactics is a material that can not be decompossed quickly. It can be serious problems for our earth if there is in high amount.\r\n\r\nDispite of that argument, I support that we should start to reduce our dependency in supermarket packages. We can bring our recycle bag from home. We might be bought it at first, but we can use continuely. Beside they are ergonomic, that idea is also supports go green movement. Furthermore, the government can also takes part in this grounbreaking idea. Authorizator have to support recycle bag in their country. If we did that simple movement, we would reap a huge fruits in future. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the arguments about who have responsibility for packaging still in debate.

A similar case was with the Korean drama Squid Game, which not only generated enormous revenue but also hit the box office worldwide. Furthermore, after the invention of popular shows and movie streaming applications like Netflix and Amazon Prime, these Adventuroeus series became hit worldwide.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these fiction and violation papers and shows release dopamine and epinephrine, thus creating a sense of happiness and flight and fight response at the same time.

Further, It also pollutes young minds and teaches them new ways to harm the norms.\r\n\r\nto conclude, In my opinion, a balance is required while reading and watching the media which contain such a sensitive subject and a child who is not more than eighteen years of age should watch it as excessive usage of anything is not only harmful to himself but also to the society.'",

This occurrence is a major drawback because it has destroyed children safe area and they cannot take advantage of natural environment and also  scenery of beautiful and lively gardens alterd to  soulless cement. For example, in previous generation people had their own garden and they planeted flowers or trees and that was eye-catching and positive for environment and households but nowadays these kind of sceneries is rare and all surroundings are soulless. I think this will  reformation is not helpful because has changed humans habits and cut the touch between nature and civilization also i believe ut will gradually impact our behavior and we cannot understand the main perpos of natural life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, demand for accomodations is in the peak state and architects had to reform buildings by eliminating some extra parts same as outdoor.

I suppose that\u2019s not a positive development. \r\n\r\nAs the development of technology smartphones have become a part of our daily life, due to its convenience. Most of student and children need smartphones to help with there education, for instance in many developed countries students hand in assignment with their mobile phone, which is more efficient and convenient. In this case they tutors can know more about their students. What\u2019s more due to the covid 19 there is a new kind of teaching way which is the online class, with the smartphones students have chance to learn knowledge wherever and whenever they want.

In this way they believe their could be safer, because of the connection. \r\n\r\nIn my viewpoint this is a negative development. At a first point, I believe that smartphones can easily influence children negatively because they are not mature enough. To begin with, kids may be induced by the games accessed by phones due to lack of self-control. For instance almost 60% of children use phone to play games instead of using it as an educational tools. This apparently wastes their time. Additionally children lack adequate judgement, result in a lack of clarify whether the information is good or bad since they may be easy to be misguide by some message on the internet. A young boy , for instance could be tempted by the advertisement on the smartphone and then gamble online. This absolutely leads him to a criminal way.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion smartphones are hitting every conner of the world due to its convenient, however children spend too much time on mobile phones is not a positive development.'",

Discuss the causes and effects.' \n 'Text': 'In the modern era, the number of overweight children in westren societies such as Euope countries, and the United States has rose up approximately 20% in the last decade. To maintain the children's health heatier, we have to solve this problem together. In this essay, I will attempt to identify causes and propose some effects that this matter bring about.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there are some main problems with this issue. Firstly, the major cause of this issue is that most children prefer high-calories food such as hamburgers, pizzas, and something like fozen foods. These foods have spicy and salty tastes and it is easier to cook so that makes children eat instant foods frequently. Secondly, another reason is that most children have bad habits such as they lie after eat, and having irregular eating time.\r\n\r\nIn terms of proposing diverse effects to this apparent dilemma, the members of socetiy, government, and researchers should cooperate together to reduce this problem. First of all, when badly habits sustained, some childrens will have indigestion and some other health problems such as diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Secondly, obesty can makes depression because, if some people dissatisfied their body shpes, they don't go out and did not prefer meet friends. As a result, that makes people always stay at home and reduce their self-confidence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, most people occasionally ignore doctors' recommendation for their happiness about overweight such as reduce eating high-calories foods, and do more exercises. Also when this behaviour and actions are sustained, this become more serious. However efforts to protect their kid's health to solve this problem sensibly and easily.'",

Therefore, I miss the past days before 15 years from now nostalgically.\r\n\r\n     However, some people believe those days deserve to be the best era for living. In my opinion, I refuse this notion for many reasons. First, although these days have rapid advancements of technology and many facilities which Make the life easier than before,they are used wrongly. As a result, people spend most time surfing the internet and browsing social media applications. Also the children became slaves to the smartphone or electronic devices. In addition, most teenagers are obsessed with YouTubers  and tick Tooker's more than studying. Secondly, there are natural disasters and wars in different places  in the present era .

But now people are exchanging the congratulations by stickers and images through WhatsApp and Facebook. In addition, our children were listening to their grandparents' stories, and they were meeting each other every weekend. Furthermore, we were feeling emotional and mental stability because we were owners and known in our country but these days we became foreigners who rent homes to live in.\r\n\r\n   In conclusion, if individuals search  for an easy life and facilities that assist in life, they will  prefer living in this era.

For instance, there are fewer death in the recent years which has lead to increase in population. Further, population rate is skyrocketing in several countries.

Therefore, it is frequently argued that students at primary school ought to study software programming, while other people believe that children must spend their times at secondary school for playing rather than focusing on hard academic topics. In my opinion, playing at primary school is more beneficial for children than studying subjects. This is due to the fact that difficulties topics make children asocial persons.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, people why think that prioritize software lessons at primary school is that children are able to improve their problem- solving skills in their childhood. In fact, when individuals advance their abilities in their child times, they would be an expert in these fields such as digital literacy. For example, a survey shows that, most employees in computer science engineering are excellent in mathematics and creativity and innovation skills. This is in light of the fact that they developed their those abilities, when they were kids. As a result, they could succeed on working professionally in computer engineering sector.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main reason for believing children at primary school should play games and do physical activities is that children need to improve their social abilities namely communication others and confidence. In other words, prominent beneficial skills for kids are advancing their personality talents. They prepare them to live better lifestyle in the future. As a matter of fact, focusing on hard subjects at childhood make them confusing and overwhelming from social lifestyles. For instance, 75% of workers in iPhone company is a well-known organization in digital sector are asocial and lonely. It is said that they spent their childhood to learn hard academic topics rather than contact each other. Consequently, they could not touch on others correctly in their workplaces.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I feel that children need to play at primary school. This is owing to the fact that, individual\u2019s childhood times is more appropriate to enjoy and live make entertainment time. Hence, they can create a good career in the future.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, software programming should educate at primary school or taught social lessons is a controversial topic.

In today\u2019s modern society, more and more children have realized that learning languages is key to their successful careers. Consequently, the number of training courses focusing on teaching languages is increasing. For example, in Mongolia, recent data shows that over one thousand companies are engaged in linguistic businesses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, gaining knowledge in science is fundamental to education because it can develop children\u2019s cognitive skills, which are extremely useful in daily life. Without science knowledge, it is difficult to imagine creating a well-developed society as it nurtures analytical and critical thinkers. Not only do skillful engineers emerge from this knowledge, but also social advocates.

Personally, I choose replacing road's environmental damaged are important to reduce any accident.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, strict punishments while driving will allow people to avoid doing violation regarding the traffic that eventually can cause harm effects to the surrounding population forward, and building rules to protect the sidewalker will genuinely help them and feel more safe while doing their daily activities. Additionally, It will be more advantage for driver due to not only build a safe ecosystem for sidewalker but also they can able to protect themselves from any harmful situation in the road ahead.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Some people tend to pick fixing some road for safety purposes preferred so much. Having a good facility such as clear sign for driver, wider space for sidewalker and driver, and also giving better travel experiences would be a good opportunities to make both of them feel more convenient. Moreover, this effort can decline a number of traffic in some areas, particularly in the cities. For instance, in the capital city like Indonesia has a tons of traffic everywhere due to lack of facilities for the driver, however, this could be solve if the government chose to put more attention for improving road safety, also this will be beneficial for the environment in a long term. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I still stick with the assumption of carrying out changes along the road will beneficial in a long term instead of stricter rules to drive for people because of reducing traffic for some places and be convenient in some way for each sidewalker or driver.

In fact, robot and Ai can do things that normal human can't do and they can done the task in the most efficient way. Moreover, Ai and robot now can communicate and have action nearly like human so they can easily understand human command.  For example, Chat GPT is the AI  that is produced by Open AI. It can answer user question easily with high precision. Moreover, Chat GPT can communicate like a real human and entertain us if we want.\r\n\r\nIn the other point of view, robot and artificial intelligence bring us many of benefits and positive changes, they even can help human in house work like cleaning, cooking, ect....

This is especially so if the company produce robots or other dependences on AI because it can create unemployment issue for people who work as a employee. Therefore, it allow the factory to do many things by just one machine. Having flexible working means that do not need a lot of people to finish. For example, with the improvement of technology, many factory choose to pay for one machine better than pay for one hundred people because it's flexible and saving money.\r\n\r\n     Another argument worth considering that AI technologies can be dangerous to human. When robots have enough time to enhance themselves, its can be very intelligent and with their strengh and clever, robots can kill people all over the world.

Due to this trend, the majority of seniors are struggling with getting a job and it also fuels employment competition. However, this problems can be alleviated by enlightening the elderly and securing vocations only for them. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, older people competing with younger people for the same position is highly unfair to the elderly as younger people possess much more enriched information and knowledge related to the occupation. For instance, they know how to answer to the job interview and how to write a successful resume as they are easy to access information through job communities such as Linked-in and other social medias. Thus, they excel at employment, making seniors harder to be employed. Moreover, this trend also culminates in overly competitive society. Therefore, a lot of people may feel depressed and drained. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, these problems can be solved by several solutions. First, the government can provide vocational training programs or videos that introduce various employment tips. This will be benefit older individuals to seek for a job more effectively and wisely as they are informed fully. As a result, it let them compete equally with young people. In addition, the society should guarantee occupations that can only be occupied by the aged. To illustrate, these can be the jobs that juniors reluctant to do: for instance, a park ranger or a building security.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, indeed, more aged people who are willing to get a job have to compete with young people for the same job. Becuase of this tendency, many individuals who opt for work are having difficulties and employment competition became severe.

Due to this, everything out there from a reedle to a brulding are becoming costly day by day. Hence, by the salary or wages from only one worker in a family. is very difficult to run a house. Furthermore, parents are also worried of very high education cast. Because, if they wants to send theus children to some better school or university, ther will denfinitely need more amount of money Lastly, educated individuals probabaly thinks. that if they don't do any kind of work, then their education qualification or degree is of no use.

Moreover, they need to use sales and another presents for their members to improve the membership. For example, many famous malls do not need to use any sale or advertisement to sell their products, because it will make their products prices fall down.

This is because the city field need more facilities to support those businesses. For instance, there are more public transportation routes around the city than rural areas due to socialization needs. Moreover, the population of people around central are significantly higher than countryside areas, so most of the services would establish nearby consumers.

For example, there are numerous number of shopping centers around the city, In contrast, there are just a few ones in the outskirt areas. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are some solutions to tackle this issue. Firstly, government should promote other lands as a business location due to spreading civilization to the countryside.

In addition, government should considerably improving more facilities in rural locations to spread the population from the city area then other services will be established along with people.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it cannot be said that the standard of living in rural areas is less rising than in city areas. this is because the population of people and also demand for service are significantly difference, but, fortunately, this problem seem to be solved by support from government.'",

However , these reasons  may leave the state with brain shortage . In my own opinion  advantages  of  leaving the national   outweighs the disadvantages. This essay will discuss further the merits.\r\n\r\n On the one hand , firstly, it is unfair to go and work outside of the country  because  this will leave the  state with shortage of brainstorm since most of  the individuals with degrees migrate to other nations, for example for the past few years  in Zimbambwe  , nurses were   migrating to England  in search of greener pastures thereby,  causing  lack of  proffessional workers  for the specific job .Nonetheless, the vice President had to put  a restriction order for nurses  to block them from leaving the country.Secondly , it  is unacepptable to use the government  resources  such  educational institute  for one to use them in another state.\r\n\r\n On the other hand , unemployment is the  major reasons why people migrate . One  needs to support their families  for example they need fees, to pay bills and food  .

For instance, crimes like kill, fraud and steal is quite difficult to authorities to ignore it and apply smooth punishment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second reason is lots of people irresponsible and do not obey the laws without methods prevented him from corruption. For instance, lots of people is scared of rules and thinking a lot before contrary regulations. If the justice is not found that will lead to spread of crimes in the society.

These medicines are so expensive that low-income people can not afford them. In these countries, unemployment is also increasing day by day leading to economic disparity between people. Moreover, Pharmaceutical companies fixed their prices at high rates making them inaccessible to underprivileged people. For instance, cancer treatment is so expensive that people die from it without getting treatment.\r\n\r\nTo reduce deaths caused by diseases for which treatment is available, I think, drug companies should make cheap medicines that are easily available to everyone. The government should also invest in the health sector, and keep an eye on these companies so that they cannot increase the prices of these medicines.The basic drugs should be available to poor people for free.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, government and pharmaceutical companies should provide relief to non-affording people in society so that they can access basic health care to get their treatment.'",

Some people think that companies should engage with communities, but from my point of view it is the government\u2019s responsibility.\r\n\r\nFirstly, from companies point of view, if firms charge an entrance fee for each visitor, the more people attend their place, the more money companies get. As a result, they will earn lots of money from that and even improve their image among the community. For instance, research suggests that proprietors of exclusive establishments frequently generate profits through the sale of merchandise and admission tickets. For some local communities these exclusive areas will often be full of people and the entrance price is not cheap. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, alternatively, governments have to provide their citizens with free sports and social fecilities. These kind of places will help citizens to improve their well-being and health.  As a result, not only the inhabitants\u2019 strength will rise, but the countries\u2019 economies will also grow significantly. For example, that could be a good investment as a tax from every citizen.

Which opinion do you agree with and why? Include specific details and examples to support your choice' \n 'Text': 'In recent years, the world has witnessed a growing advocacy for equal rights from different groups of people including feminists. There are quite a number of people who are standing up for women to get equal opportunities at the work places. However, this view is opposed by the die hard traditional men who pessive women as beings that belong at homes taking care of children and doing common hosehold chores. In this essay, I will explain and give reasons why I agree with the old fashioned community who are agaisnt women pessuing careers at an equal rate with men.\r\n\r\nFirstly, women were created to be helpers of men as we learn from the Holy Bible. Therefore, it is taboo to hear that women are competing with men in the work place. Their duty is to support the man, that is the head of the family. These days we are witnessing women leaving new born babies at day care centres or with a hired child minder. Marriages are collapsing due to these over ambitious women, instead of staying at home taking care of children, doing house chores, cooking and providing emotional support to their husbands, they are busy puting effort on how to earn more than a ma. I persive this as an act of defiance of subsimision to men.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly, females are not as strong as men, be it mentaly or physically. There is no way they can out match their counterparts of the same trade. Yes they are there woman who are talented in certain areas, for example in computer science, but truthfully speaking there is a man twice as good, moreover men have more endurance and higher ability of problem solving, so even if they are employed at the same level their salaries should not be the same. So it is pointelss to appoint a woman on that post. Therefore, women should stick to their domestic value and leave careers for men.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the issue of equal rights is not for the faint hearted, it needs a strong understanding of our calture and traditions. Women should not fight with nature, they should accept their calling of being the heart of the house and stop competing with the heads of the house in the industries and coporate world.'",

There are two types of complaints, complaints by writing and face-to-face. I personally prefer to complain by directly addressing the person in charge directly. \r\n\r\nSome people like to tell their problems by writing in a customer satisfaction survey that had been given to them. The buyers do not have any pressure to write down their badexperiences and tend to give an honest reviews about the product they used.  However, the buyers can not deny that complaining through a survey seems to be hard to get a fast response because the company has to check all of the answers first.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these days, there is a significant increase in a number of customers who do complain by meeting with the customer service staff. They feel more comfortable to tell the real issue that they have. In addition, this schema of complaint is giving faster responses to the buyers especially when the thing that they bought is broken. For example, if there is a phone cannot be restarted the technician will fix it then maybe there are some rules that you have to know directly from the staff. Therefore, it is better to give the feedback in person.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, my choice of giving a complaint in a face-to-face meeting yields the trust of its clients in the enterprise's performance, even though, the writing schema is great too.

Although this situation has some  positives, in my opinion, the negative are greater.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are  significant the benefits or positives of the cars will be driven by computers. The first one is that, when use computers replace to drivers, families having a travel, it can not need a member to drive car, in this time, everybody in family has time together without to control vehicle. Futhermore, the salary to pay for driver by the month can cut down along with this becames a reason that made cost are more expensive than driverless car.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the cars, which is directed by computer bring two main risks. Firstly, the car depends on nagigation systems in order to drive in places that clients require, when electric maps in computer is wrong, the car can not attain customer's request. Secondly, computer do not have flexible ability and emotion since in some urgent instances it can not deal with as appropriate result as human. For example, when incident occur, if clients seriously injured or lay unconscious, instead of looking for asissting from the same as human, machines and systems just slience or break.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in spite of some positives such as spending time for neccessary working and reducing cost, I think cars without people direct has more negative of losing one's way and unexpected incidents.'",

Give your opinion with relevant examples?' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that kids are being forced by their mom and dad to succeed, while others think that they should be taught the importance of being cooperative instead. Although imposing the importance of success in children can force them to work hard, I believe that cooperation is more important because it teaches them to work on a team.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, forcing children to be successful in life can help them to work hard. Instilling this mindset on them can make them believe that if they work hard enough they will be able to achieve anything they want in life.  They will be more competitive and this can also enhance their confidence, as a result they will be more successful. For instance, Elon Musk said that he was more motivated to do well in school because his parents expected him to be a dean's lister when he was studying. However, teaching kids to be cooperative is more important  because it can help them to work on a team.\r\n\r\nCooperation teaches children the value of working with others. It can help them learn that sharing the workload can get things done faster. It does not only help them know their strenghts and weaknesses but as well as others, thus, this collaboration can achieve greater success. For example,most company required their employee to be a good team player because they know that this is essential for the growth of the company. Hence, I believe that working with others plays a more imporatant role in children's lives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though forcing a child to be successful encourage them to work harder, I think that cooperation teaches them the importance of working with others.'",

I do not agree with this idea and children should be examined by standardized tests. Given standardized tests with clear guide and criteria would be necessary because it helps to right evaluation for teachers and suitable exam preparation for students\r\n\r\nFirstly, having standardized tests give opportunity to right evaluation for examiners, without standard evaluation process could be hard to check pupil's ability. This is because teachers usually develop curriculum on their subjects, therefore, exams are demonstrated according to the content that have thaught in the classroom and students can prepare their exams by the given framework. For example, on history subject, if there is not standard, it would be hard to prepare for the exam because the concept of history is much broad area that everyone can understand by their own way of perspective. Therefore, school tests should be regulated by given criteria. \r\n\r\nSecondly, test norms will be guide for children's exam preparation and they can prepare their exams from the previous tests and it could be direction for them. For example, IELTS test has own standard and criteria,  and if test takers understand them, the result would be better than takers who do not know the standard. As a result, schools tests should be standardized, therefore clear guideline and criteria should be developed by educators. \r\n\r\nFinally, standardized test can be evaluated wrong by pedagogies and can be given false mark to students, however, I believe that the given mark can be fixed, if students think that it is not true. As a result, schools need to have standards on their exam, which would be easy for teachers and it helps to avoid marking from the personal view of point. \r\n\r\nTo condlude, school tests should be standardized with clear guideline and criteria, which would help to evaluate the students' skills.

I support the latter idea and this essay will delve into both perspectives with some supporting ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, taking challenges for changing lives are a great opportunity because normally people do not know their boundaries and limits without take risks, moreover, it improves humans ability that they did not know before. Therefore, changing comfort zone is good for people who want to upgrate their circumstances. Even though, any change in our life can be hard in the first time, but people will get used to it in their following life-time. For example, most people want to buy apartment, however, only some of them take risks such as paying morgage leasing because others believe that it is hard to pay it monthly. However, it is true that high payment for leasing is challenging, at least they can live in their own apartment because they wanted to make change in their lives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, doing the changes would be risky because we cannot say what will happen in the future, therefore, some people do not want to make changes in their life. For example, if someone gets sick, he or she cannot earn money for their expenses, and it would be harsh situation in their life. However, if we can take care ourselves and nurture our healthy being, anyone can do anything unless they are extremely sick. As a result, in my opinion make difference in our life is a great chance to improve our recent situation.\r\n\r\nTo conlclude, while making changes are difficult in their first step, it would be easier in the following days and people will get used to it. If we always sit on our comfort zone, our lives would not improve. Consequently, in my opinion, making difference is always good opportunity to level-up our lives.'",

They should prepare to be more savvy, in terms of concentrating on college bachelors.

Firstly, in the past, population density was lower, and transportation and infrasturcture may have differed from today's standards. In particular, While there were fewer vehicles in the past, today's increased traffic volumes can lead to congestion on outdated roads. Secondly, environmental pollution will occur commonly.

I reckon that other methods should be formulated to avoid traffic but tariffs can cause burden on an individual's budget and this is a negative development.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we are living in the era of an exorbitantly high inflation and an ordinary man cannot afford such kind of extra remittances to pay to the government. However, authorities are creating newer kind of taxes to reduce the high influx of the vehicles on the road. This situation is creating a struggle between the powerful entities and the general public. The regulatory bodies must consult the masses before considering these types of rules. Apparently, public will never accept these extra payments to the government which could overwhelm their pocket. Every individual think that they deserve to travel on road during any hour whether it is rush hour or not, because they have to go to office, school and many more places.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the taxation could also waste the state resources in a wrong way which could be utilized in numerous useful manners. For instance, they have to hire new individuals to collect penalty and also they could not control the corruption that may result from such measures. Apart from this, it hinders the movement of public on the road, which they deserve to move freely on the road, for which they paid income tax. It could turn a democratic society into totalitarian society.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, these rules should be avoided by the government because it has the potential to disrupt financial statements of commom households. Additionally, it reduces their freedom to travel and causes the society to become more authoritarian than democratic.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is a conflicting view among people for the average age of drinking. Several believe that it ought to be above the current set age which is 21 years, whilst others think that it should be up to an individual and age shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor. This essay will discuss the reasons for both views, which are the impact of drinking on one\u2019s career and health and lack of self-discipline in many youngsters.\r\n\r\nThe current set age for drinking alcohol is 21 years, which is very important duration of time to build the career. Actions taken during this age contribute a lot towards building the successful career. And alcohol or any sort of addictive substance interrupts a lot in focusing on something that requires continuous hard work and self-discipline. It is therefore agreed that alcohol consumption should be legalized for the age of people above 25 years. This is due to the fact that most of the individuals have completed the initial hard work required for building successful career by this age.\r\n\r\nHowever, others contend against this view point and argue that individuals should have the right to decide when they should start drinking, and age shouldn\u2019t be given the preference while making that decision. Moreover, they also advocate that people are rational and, they can decide what is good for them. On the contrary, as per the survey conducted by the Harvard Research Center, only 20% of the youngsters actually put efforts to avoid things that give them temporary gratification despite knowing their future ramifications. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, drinking age should be above the current set age of 21 years because steps taken towards the future career goal are paramount for success, and alcohol prevents youngsters from putting required hard work for the same. Additionally, not all the people are disciplined enough to abstain themselves from addictive substances despite knowing their harmful effects.'",

Some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'People are rewarded with exorbitant amount of payments for their work in some of the nations. While some sections of individuals say that this is positive development but others believe that this practice should be discontinued and the government should regulate the earnings. I reckon that high performers should be rewarded adequately and it shoud not be limited by the government.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the high paid jobs are done by the highly qualified individuals who usually gain such kind of positions after long time of hard work and determination. Also, their jobs include too much stress and the burden of responsibilities which should be remitted with high salaries. For example, doctors have to go through almost ten years of contionous effort to gain that degree and qualification to practice in that profession. Eventually, this is the most sought after career because of such charateristics. If the government will try to control the salary of such careers then it could lead to demotivation among people to do these jobs. These professions are already lacking talented workforce and this regulation could certainly lead to less choosing such fields in the future.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the employees who are more creative and productive benefit through their expertise and earn more pay than any ordinary worker of the company. Therefore, an individual should be appraised in a timely manner to get promoted to better ranks. Hence, resulting in more pay. Eventually, it promotes an effective and qualtitative work standards at the workplace. It also encourages employee to earn more skills and contribute to their team which finally contributes to the complete transformation of an organization. So, the governments should not destablize such platforms.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, certain individuals are paid better due to their qualifications and expertise in the company they work for. Hence, I reaffirm my opinion that these individuals deserve such kind of appraisals and should not be controlled by the government.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary era, many people have the tendency to shift from one employer to another more often than before during their course of lives. It can have various upsides and downsides which will be examined further in the essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are numerous positive impacts that come with changing jobs. First and foremost is the growth of an individual's skills at different jobsites. While a person changes his company, he gets opportunity to improve his expertise in his present set of talents also he could gain experience in other fields as well. For example, the current employers generally never tend to change responsibilities of employees because they do not want to lose a stable employee but at a new workplace the employer tests the employee at different positions to know their adroitness. Nextly, the people who change their workplaces frequently are able to negotiate their salary better than their present employer. For instance, the present employers only raise salary to a certain limited extent but the new employer offers better income offers due to past achievements of the jobseeker.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there are some shortcomings of this trend. First problem arise when a person is not able to concentrate in one field of interest and constant changing of roles at varied organizations cause a lack of focus. Consequently, it leads to less pay raise by employer and chances to rise to higher positions become meager. Thus, new careers may not allow an individual to built an expertise the field. Finally, another reason ascribing to the negative side is the inability to maintain connections within the same career when a person can have an opportunity to create relations in the long run. While a person shifts from one job to another he cannot make strong relations with his colleagues and boss because many employers prefer long term retention of human resources. Thus, they do not pay attention to employees who take interest for short term period. Even they will not readily train an employee properly before a probabtion period of six months or even a year. Thus, a person could miss certain great options of training which only long term and patient players achieve in their fields.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are plethora of positives and negatives of continuous change of employers. Although, an individual may better negotiate his pay and new workplace alongwith chances of learning new skills are provided but some employers may identify short terms players and may never consider them for their job or even some people may not be able to gain expertise in their career.'",

Governments should discourage people from constantly buying more up to date or fashionable products. To what extent do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is a well-established fact that people use natural resources faster than they can be renewed, and due to this reason it is important for the government to discourage people from buying up-to-date and fashionable products, and instead encourage them to buy more long lasting products. I completely agree with this idea and there are two principal reasons for this. \r\n\r\nOne point which I believe to be absolutely pivotal is the fact that after some time all the natural resources will be gone and it will have a huge negative impact not only on the nature or the lifestyle of people, but also on the world economy because a lot of companies will suffer from this and more people will be unemployed. Several examples can be which serve to illustrate this point. There have been published a lot of articles on this topic, too. As an example, deforestation in South America has become a huge issue and a lot of people are concerned about it. Because without forests more animals will be distinct and of course, the absence of trees would affect people, too. \r\n\r\nAdding further credibility to the statement brings to an idea of fluctuations in economy of the world. Admittedly, it will lead a lot of companies to bankruptcy and more people will suffer from unemployment. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, by taking into account all the above mentioned reasons, I once again reaffirm my position that it is important for the government to encourage people to use long lasting products because in this case, the natural resources would be renewed.'",

It would be better if there was only one language in the world\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of everyone in the world speaking the same language?' \n 'Text': 'There is a widely held perception that communication among various nationalities becomes way more difficult because they speak different languages. And it would be way better to have only one common language, so people will not have any difficulties while talking to people from other nationalities. However, there are both pros and cons when we apply it to the real world. \r\n\r\nLet's begin by looking at the advanatges of speaking only one language all over the world. One of the main positives would probably be the fact that no one would struggle with language barrier. What I mean by this is that nowadays, even if people learn one language for many years they cannot speak it like native speakers. This causes a huge problem for language learners, however if everyone would speak the same language from their childhood, this problem would disappear. \r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the argument every nation's culture is hidden in their language. And this leads to the fact that cultures will lose their unique part, possibly along with their traditions and customs. Moreover, learning new languages helps people to improve their brain activity and makes their outlook wider, which is one of the main positive sides of learning new langauges. \r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, all the reasons that were mentioned before lead us to a conclusion that speaking one langauge throughout the world may have some positive sides, but along with that cultures will lose their unique traditions customs and so on. Moreover, in this case, the majority of people will stop learning new languages and this will lead to the fact that people will stop learning other cultures and the history of those cultures which would affect their outlook in a negative way. Personally, I believe that having various languages around the world is important and countries should not change their nation's languages to one common.'",

In this essay I will discuss both views and I will write what are the disadvantages and advantages for both. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, having only one job could have advatages and also disadvantages. For example, some advantages could be that working in the same place for long time, can bring you a lot of bonuses and promotions, and also you will get better and better on your position. Secondly, having the same job, and working only for one company forever could make you tired and keep you in the cofort zone, which is a disadvantage. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some persons will preffer to change their job all the time, and this could be and advatage when is about to learn more than one thing and develop your skills, changing job all the time can also bring  you a lot of connections with different people and your cv will be also a large one. When is about disadvantages, if the job is changed frequently, the chance to get promoted will be reduced and the chance to get really good at something, will also be reduced because you will not have time to see if you are good or not, if you can improve or not, because you always change the job. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, having only one job, or changing the job frequently, have advantages and disadvantages and the best choise is to find the balance between these two, change your job until you are happy where you are and feel ready to try more than one job, but in the end, I believe that having only one job will be better instead of change the job all the time.'",

Albeit, smart devices are unfortunately accounted for the disturbance of privacy and being such convenient devices, they can often lead to addiction. \r\n\r\nInformation about individuals on the internet spread in a matter of minutes; being such a large network, it is almost impossible to control. For example, Taylor Swift wears disguises to alter her appearance in the hopes of not being identified, otherwise her location will be available for the entire world in a few minutes. Moreover, these devices can also distribute personal images and videos of not only celebrities, but everyday people. Thus, the internet undoubtedly disrupts the privacy of people.  \r\n\r\nThe internet is a gateway to obtain information on almost everything, which results in the majority of individuals constantly being on mobile devices.

To be honest, I believe that nurseries or other pre-school courses are the best thing in baby care institute. This essay will discuss both of beliefs and explain the reasons of supporting my point of view. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people think that grandparents will be better careers for their children due to several reasons, such as their unrequited love. The supporters of this point of view truly believe that there is no safe place for their preschool age kids except home while there are a lot of terrible news about cruel teachers of nursery in different regions of our country. For example, I\u201dve read about death of 3 years child during his walk with teacher in the nursery in Almaty city 2 years ago. Also, there is no secret that kids, which attend nurseries are the regular patients of  hospitals with different kinds of diseases. For this reason, many people prefer staying at home with their grandparents untill they will attemp a school. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the opponents of this, including me, think that grandparents have a right to live their own life, travelling or doing what they want while their grandchildren can enjoy their pre-school time with their peers. For example, my children have attempted the nursery at the age of 3, and there are a lot of advantages which I\u2019ve seen. They became more independent and social active rather than their peers, which parents decided their kids to stay at home untill school age. Also they\u2019ve never had a trouble with their studies at the first year of school, because they were totally ready to this due to the variety of lessons in nursery. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   In conclusion, despite some people think that grandparents will take care of their kids better than nurseries, it has been increasingly noticed that, children must socialize and attempt the educational places long before their first day at school.'",

Personally, I believe that the culture of our country of origin has less effect on us, rather than other things. This essay will discuss both sides of this view, and will widely explain the reasons to support my opinion based on real life examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people believe that the birth nation has an important role in setting an individual\u2019s culture, due to several reasons. The supporters of this point of view are sure that one\u2019s behaviour starts to develop in the womb. Finally they say: people learn the culture even before they were born. Although, people travel everywhere and even live in the other side of world, they will always be connected to their motherland, since they developed an emotional attachment with their birth place\u2019s culture. For example, Irina Sheyk, a very popular fashion model from Russia, even though, she spent most of her life in United States of America, she never lost her love towards Russian traditional cuisine or wear. For this reason, many people think that an individual\u2019s birthplace plays a dramatic role in defining the culture.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the opponents of this, including me, think that native location has a minor influence on behaviour development. Many researches have proved that humans are capable of adapting to any conditions and traditions. There is even a proverb such as \u201c Don\u201dt go to someone\u201ds monastery with your rules\u201d. Many people prefer to stick to foreign traditions, where they live and forget about their owns. For example, I\u2019ve met many kazakh families, which live several years in United Kingdom, and they are fond of english life culture, their practicality and callousness, which totally contradict with kazakh\u2019s lifestyle. Due to this trend in society, I strongly believe that native locations have less influence in defining the character of the person.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some people think that the culture of an individual depends on their birthplaces, it has been increasingly noticed that, humans are adapting to various cultures due to their location for today or their influence of globalization.'",

Furthermore, the ability to travel faster by private car discourages people from using the public transport, which causes far less air pollution by transporting more people by one bus or tram.\r\n\r\n     In addition, existence of ring roads has a negative impact to pedestrians and cyclists. For example, when we had travelling to Dubai city with my immediate family last year, instead of walking down the streets, we had to get a taxi even for a tiny distance because of ring road system, which we were not able to cross.

In other words, nowadays, children learn to chat with their friend by typing with the help of their hands; however, when they meet anyone in person it becomes very difficult for them to communicate. For example, I belong to a joint family. When I was a child, we were eight children in our family and we all were very talkative with our families and relatives, in contrast, now we have six children in are family, but they all are introverts they all keeps chatting on their phone but never comes out of their room and talk with their family. Nevertheless, when youngsters are unsupervised there is high risk of falling for any e-scam. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others and I believe that social networking has some perks such as, connecting globally and it keeps you posted regarding current affairs. To explain, a person sitting in Japan can talk to a person living in Canada. Additionally, maintaining relationships with your friends and relatives has been way easier now.

Some analyzers believe that individuals are more likely affected by their colleagues at work or friends in their youth. They also proved advertisements encourage young citizens to buy different things. Therefore, young adults try to spend their time to buy somethings which are used by more people or they watch on TV advertising. For example, apple company conducted a survey and announced that most young people prefer to buy apple's products as luxury items. \r\n\r\nSome experts prove that young should encourage to do beneficial activities instead of shopping as a hobby. They believe that if youth go to gym or doing yoga instead of go shopping, they will be fit and also can save money. In my opinion, in addition to doing sports activities, young people can learn new skills in their leisure time by participating in online courses and enhanced their self-esteem . For instance, some big companies offer numerous free courses annually for their young employees not only to learn new skills, but their young members also can enjoy their free time during these workshops. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to some ideas, youth are being shopaholic because of wrong advertisements.

Especially, in some cultures, parents and teachers have told to children that if they work hard and have concrete plans they will succeed certainly. Generally speaking, this message has some pros and cons that in this essay I will discuss and elucidate my opinion. \r\n\r\nLets begin by looking at the advantage. One of the main positive points of encouraging youngsters to gain things that they want is that, they attempt hard which leads to some extent being successful and give motivation to hone themselves more and more. In fact, the more they are sermonized, the more they achieve.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this can push children not only to achieve anything that they want, but also for not being lazy and active which this makes it possible for children to spend time with those who are interested in succeeding, and this action can have a direct effect on their future. Take children who goes to gym and study with children who are stay at home and play video games, explicitly, the first group of children will gain more than the second.\r\n\r\nTurning on the other side of the argument, this action can be kind of daydream due to existing some factors that can be effective, such as affluent parents and nice culture as well as favouritism on children future. What\u2019s more, when they encounter reality, it can make youngsters depress and feel emptiness.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that, if they don\u2019t achieve anything that they wanted, they will be irate from their culture and do some bad thing, For instance, they might suicide or leave their hometown and such staff. \r\n\r\nAll in all, as can be seen from the points in this essay, you need to weigh up the positive and negative points. In spite of the fact that, it is efficient to cultures tell children to being bully and work hard for life and anything they want, in my opinion, should be to somewhat otherwise their expectations will rise which can be harmful.'",

This essay shed light upon possible reasons as well as its consequences.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, many reasons are assosicated with the fact of reduction of writing skills. The dominant reason is advancement of technological inventions. To be more specific, exposure to use electronic gadgets due to work or school curriculm is motivating to use online applications for typing rather then writing by hand. Therefore, due to presence of technical resources people prefer not to write. It has been observed that, electronic applications are convenient to use as comapred to old writing methods. To be precise, such online platforms have useful features like grammar and vocabulary auto- correction softwares which makes them less time -consuming with better outomes. As a result, there are hardly any chances of misinterpretation and errors.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, despite the merits, there are people those who think writing noy by hand is a negative developlment.The contributing factore is, loss of a skill. To elaborate, writing is not jsut limited to taking notes, but its an artform. There are many schools and colleges that organize writing competions such as calligraphy.

It is clear that the life behin bars will help them realise their serious consequences and promote forward to positive direction. One more reason is that receiving prison sentences for people who commit crimes is more effective to express the power of political system.

However, I disagree with that sentiment because of the following reasons. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, through team sports, nevertheless, children already design their own strategy to achieve collective purposes. It is because in sports, children deem to be selective when recruit other people to their teams. In other words, the are likely to choose someone who is either already close or reliable to them since the purpose is to win a game, which contradicts with the fundamental aims of working together with other people. Therefore, it deters them to procure essential traits that can be learned through cooperative work such as tolerance and respect, as they think the situation is already under control. It can be seen when boys are likely teaming up with talented students in football match, and left behind some of their peers that cannot support them to win the game. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is another activity besides team sports that is more effective to taught children on working as a team. Take, for example, a group project, where children are likely to be united with random people from different background. Referring from Albert Bandura\u2019s research, this method was found to be reliable and prominent among kindergarten students because they were not solely focus to accomplish collective purposes whilst they also learn to unify different personalities and values, which in turn broadens their perspectives. Furthermore, the research also revealed that after involved in the group projects, students were willing to befriend with anyone in the classroom, which eventually alleviate social discrepancies between each student and hinder them from detrimental behaviours such as bullying. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the notion that team sports is the best approach to introduce children in working together. It is because in team sports, children already find their own way to achieve collective purpose.

For example, during the recent decade, Tehran has been suffering from heavy traffic which leads to more air pollution and most of its inhabitants deal with lung disease. Furthermore, some studies illustrate that crime is more likely in the big cities. In other words, in the metropolitan cities, having control on all parts of the city can be challenging, thus theft happens even more.\r\n\r\n  Some possible solutions for these problems are establishing more public transportation and using electrical vehicles and also nurturing more policemen. To be clear,  the government should improve access to the public transport sectors so people use them more than their own cars. Also using the electrical machines can be more useful due to the fact that they do not consume fossil fuels, so it can help to reduce air pollution. Additionally, fostering more police staff and recognizing more video recorders can improve cities' security from robbers' attacks. \r\n\r\n    To conclude, Although the quality of life in the large cities face risk of degradation by increasing air pollution and crime rate, there are some possible solutions for these problems.

Contemporary technology in teaching is very convenient and timesaving for students as well as for teachers. The primary advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon are discussed in the following passages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are various benefits of using new technologies for teaching students. Firstly, through the conventional method, it is very difficult for teachers to explain the complex topics to students. But, after the advent of new audio-visual technology, it is very easy to explain the tough topics with the help of animations. Additionally, since most educational institutes have adopted online teaching, students can easily learn from anywhere in the world, which is very convenient and timesaving. \r\n\r\nDespite these advantages, there are many drawbacks of new technologies which not only affect the learning curve of students, but it affects the overall health of pupils. First, it is nearly impossible for teachers to know if students are paying attention while teaching online and as a result, most students can\u2019t score well in exams.

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is an ongoing debate regarding the merits of group activities versus individual activities in terms of developing important life skills. In this context, there are proponents who argue that group activities hold more prominence due to their collaborative nature, and I partially concur with this viewpoint. Nevertheless, I presumably believe that personal pursuits can also provide valuable life skills, if not more so.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, advocates of activities done in group often highlight their collaborative nature of this endeavour, suggesting that people can mandate teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. In other words, working in a team setting can provide individuals with opportunities to learn how to cooperate, delegate tasks, and resolve conflicts effectively. This is mainly because group activities often simulate real-life scenarios where individuals must learn how to navigate diverse perspectives and work towards their common goals.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is essential to recognise that solo pursuits offer an equal amount of invaluable life lessons. Undertaking such tasks alone renders its participant the ability to foster his self-reliance, independence, and accountability. This is because, while working independently, individuals must rely on their own judgement, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance to overcome challenges when compared to the approach of group activities. Therefore, in my view, this self-reliance not only instills confidence and resilience, but could also empower individuals to tackle obstacles with determination and resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nA further advantage, somewhat related to the one mentioned above, is that solo activities will provide their inherent traits in deep introspection and personal growth. When working alone, individuals do have more freedom and pace with their own time to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and discover their strengths as well as weaknesses without a large scale of external influences. This self-discovery is especially integral to developing a strong sense of identity and purpose, which lies the main foundation for personal fulfilment and success in life. In addition to that, individual pursuits often require a high degree of focus and concentration, so honing essential skills such as time management, organisation, and critical thinking is siginificantly crucial in the scenario that if one wants to be an independent learner. \r\n\r\nIn summarising up, although group activities undoubtedly offer valuable opportunities for collaboration and interpersonal development, I contend that solo endeavours can teach equally important life skills. Self-reliance, independence, personal growth, and critical thinking are just a few examples of the invaluable skills that individuals can acquire through individual pursuits. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that group activities are superior to imparting essential life skills.'",

With many people claiming that it is beneficial , others rejct this notion. The substantial influence of this stringent law on this age group has sparked the controversy over the potential impact of this trend in recent years. In my opinion, this strict action appears to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate both positive and negative effects of the curfew and thus will reach a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere are myriad of reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one stems from the fact of safety concerns as the curfew is necessary for the safety and security of teenagers from potential dangers such as crimes or accidents during late hours. For example, a recent news became very popular in US where a teenager was driving without driver license and killed 2 in crash. In this era, it's hard for the parents to handle their kids at home without these strict laws.\r\n\r\nThere are some pitfalls, however, that negate this arguments and which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this overly restrcition can hinder teenagaers ability to socialize, develop, independecne, and make their own decisions.Approach to deal with these alarms which are numerous but the most effective one is flexibility among these laws which is comprehensive and feasible approach.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell one can reach a conclusion that there should be different arrnagements for educational, employment and family emergencies as this highlights the need for a balanced approach that considers individual circumstances.'",

The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement? You should use your own ideas, knowledge and, experience and support your answer with examples and relevant evidence.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays there is a lot of discussion that the only women have responsible for having whether or not children and also, they have more responsible for taking care of them. In my opinion, I partly agree with this suggestion and I will give some examples in the bellow of this essay.\r\n\r\n Firstly, gender inequality still exists in this modern society. In this kind of issues we can see in the hiring to job. Many companies still prefer men for some type of work rather than women. For example, when I graduated university and went to the interview and the first question of interviewers was the \u201cWhen I planning to get married?\u201d. This one of the gender inequalities we have in our Uzbek society and this society gives more attention and opportunity for the Manship. So that is why, men give more their forces for their career and they don\u2019t have time for their family.\r\n\r\n I addition to this, the men consist of the breadwinner and this view cannot be change for more time. They have also more duty to breed their family, but not just their children and spouses but also their parents. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fatherhood play vital role in the developing their offspring\u2019s physically and emotionally. Many researchers have proved that fatherly love is one the important aspects in the healthy family. Child which grows up in healthy conditions don\u2019t have social problems. Besides this they can easily find they spot in the society. For instance, my cousin\u2019s mother is the second wife. Father of my cousin has first family and children. He had tried to spend more his free time with the first family, so my cousin grow up in this condition and her character is little difficult. She always wants to be in the center of the group and require more attention from other people. She became unconfident. \r\n\r\nOverall, fatherhood is vitally important aspects in the child life, so that\u2019s why fathers have to pay more attention for raising and caring their children as equal their mothers.'",

For example, there is a disesase called screen autisim in which child understand the object or animal or identify colors on t.v but not in front of it.\r\n\r\nOn th contrary Many objects which are harmful in their natural settings like wild animals or many off season fruits and vegetable can be taught in this way,thus a kin can have a knowledge on it with out its access.It not only save money but also time and also can help parents to focus on their work while the child is watching it on scree. For example many documentry channels like national geographic provide first hand experience to the viewer.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,I personally believe that in hand expeirence is more resourcful then what taught online and a balance between both is necessory in order for our youth to learn.'",

Do you agree?'' \n 'Text': 'Climate change is indeed a pressing threat to our planet, yet political action to curb excessive consumerism and pollution is lacking. While governments have acknowledged the severity of the situation, their response has been insufficient.\r\n\r\nExcessive consumerism, driven by a culture of materialism and economic growth, contributes significantly to climate change. Despite growing awareness, governments have been slow to implement policies that promote sustainable consumption and production. This inertia allows corporations to prioritize profits over environmental concerns, perpetuating the cycle of consumption and pollution.\r\n\r\nPollution, particularly from industrial activities, exacerbates the effects of climate change by emitting greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants. While some governments have introduced measures to reduce emissions, such as carbon pricing, these efforts have often been insufficient due to political inertia and vested interests.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while climate change is recognized as a grave threat, political action to address the root causes of excessive consumerism and pollution is lacking. To effectively combat climate change, governments must prioritize environmental sustainability and implement policies that promote responsible consumption and production. Only through concerted political action can we hope to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.'",

This essay would delve into the problem caused by this trend and suggest some practical solution to address this issue.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, one of the obvious problems caused by this trend is unhealthy dieting is on the increase. In other words, many young females are starving to loose weight and become thin, as a consequence, they are in the clutches of illness. For example, a new young model dead due to the overfasting in several days and loosing protein that is essential for the body maintenance. similarly, fat body women are being insulted and body shamed. The poeple have misconsumption that fat body is due to the intake of over food consumption, in turn, these fat young females are insulted publically and private parties become commonplace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are some practical solution to tackle this issue to a great extend. Firstly, proper guidance should be provided for the young people to diet and loose body weight. In detail, health education should be provided by not only health authorities but also  universitites. The awareness for the proper dieting would reduce this issue. The authorities should be make strict laws and guidance to medias about  body shaming and harassment. By doint this the mental harassment for fat women can be reduced significantly.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, unhealthy dieting is one of the main diadavantage of the thin-body fashion concept. similarly, mental harassment is the another negative effect of this trend.

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There are opposite views whether it is better to live in urban or rural areas. This essay will discuss both views alongside with my own opinion on each notion. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, living in big cities grants people an easy access to top-tier facilities. It is inevitable that the privilege of urban people lays on the easy accessibility from advanced public facilities such as hospitals that heightens the opportunity of people to live a better life. It can be seen from several cases that can be found in capital cities like Seoul or Jakarta, where people easily perceive detail and comprehensive medical examinations as well as treatments, supported by sophisticated equipment, since to reach those facilities people only require to make an ambulance call, once they suffer from certain symptomps. As a result, it can deter the percentage of people who likely to experience chronic diseases, which in turn increasing life expectancy and decreasing death tolls. Regardless that view; however, I disagree that reside in big cities is a beter option since it can be unsafe as the criminal rates are particularly higher.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having an outskirts live can make people physically and mentally healthy. Notwithstanding with an eminent fact that there is a likelihood its people will be provided with better air quality since there is a scarcity to find gasoline-based vehicles, which being the biggest threat to human\u2019s respiratory systems, rural areas also prompt a condition that support better mental health conditions to human beings because it drift them apart from the typical hustle and bustle conditions in big cities. This notion is supported through a recent survey from NHS that unveil almost 76% of British people are likely live in rural areas compared to big cities because they feel mentally and phsyically better. As a result, it can increase people\u2019s life satisfactions and hinder them from the potential psychological disturbance such as stress or depression. Regarding that notion, I agree with the decision to live in rural areas because it can benefit to the health levels of people in the long run. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though reside in big cities gives privilege to easily reach top-tier facilities for a better quality of life, it is not foreshortened the fact that people\u2019s safety is also at risks with the higher rates of criminal activities. Therefore, I deem to agree with the idea to live in a rural area because it can provide both mentally and physically healthy environments, which benefit in the long run.'",

On the other hand, it is unfortunate to work for small businesses. In my opinion this notion is actually right for many reasons.\r\n\r\n    First, large organisations Offer more opportunities for advancement in a large-scale community. That means more opportunities to develop and grow through formal training programs which are often available in these companies. In addition there are a breadth  of roles which makes  the employee be able to make moves and Try different roles. As well as have more promotions. Furthermore, a larger company means a larger pool of talents. That means the worker will learn from people who are experts in their field and achieve  professional and personal development.  Finally, the diversity in workspace helps workers to meet a broad range of people with varied skill-sets. As well as make friends and more social relationships.\r\n\r\nSecond reason,  large companies often offer competitive salaries and extra perks for employees, that include health Insurance, dental and eye care. In addition, they can offer on-site child care for parent employees, gym memberships, also cafeterias and restaurants. Moreover, sometimes they provide employees with tools such as,  laptop or a company car that can help set the employee up for success.

Whom does this affect more, parents or children?' \n 'Text': 'Globally, human beings are working every day to support their families, however, this can cause them to stay away from their infants.Therefore, this can result in loneliness and I would like to suggest that many sons and daughters are mostly affected by this situation, although parents will suffer mentally too.Hence, in this essay, I am going to discuss why children are affected more.\r\n\r\nCommencing, most of the fathers and mothers are grafting at least six days in a week and taking long shifts such as 12 to 16 hour shifts.Additionally, without doing this, it will be a problem so that they cannot afford to feed their adolescents and not even buy them clothes or electric gadgets.Meanwhile a child is always demanding, others wants to go to vacation and as a parent you have to pay tuitions all the time to keep them growing wisely.Furthermore, mostly juveniles are in trouble, because they are spending most of their time without their parents which can cause loneliness diseases, since parents are always at work.A very good example to mention is that, those who are based in the UK, for a family to survive, they must graft 24/7 to get enough salary which covers bills, transport, insurance as well as food.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many teens are always stay without someone who can look after them, this is because some of current parents are studying whilst they are getting old.An example to illustrate that could be  people in my native country Zimbabwe, some of these family members travel to Poland and England to study nursing degree for about three years.Thus, they did this in the  sense that they can support their teenagers in the long run but at the same time children will be alone in Africa.This is clear that a toddler need his or her parent to grow up with discpline and will not suffer from depression while thinking of their parents.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in the world, parents are always work and save money for their future lives, however, their chidren are suffering from loneliness due to the fact that they spend less time with their parents.'",

In fact, if employees are able to choose their working hours in variety times , they would spend their time more freely. For example, in 2020, Ziraat Bank in Turkey, giving a gold chance for its workers to start their work in various time. As a result, The Ziraat Bank obtained best company reward from Turkish locals in this years .\r\n\r\nAdditionally, doing outside programs among colleges and high salary have ability to motivate workers. Obviously, many workers are confused from stressful and hard working. Hence, companies should have organize outside traveling events to enjoy employees each others . For instance, Google company found in a statistic, most of Google company are happy with in this organization. This is light of the fact that the company organize two times outside visiting per month. As a result, it succeed in motivating its workers. Another prominent factor is that giving extra money for workers surprisedly. In other words, money is extremely fundamental element to work individuals today\u2019s world. Hence, adding some amount of salary can feel better for employees. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, creating flexible working hours would be satisfaction employees in their working.

I agree to the given statement that prevention is better than cure because after treatment the damage done to mental status can not be fully recovered. This essay will shed light why I am in favour of providing health education and prevention measures to people.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, preventive measures are cost-effective in long run, reducing the overall financial burden on the healthcare system and pockets of common man. For example, in India, more than 70 million people are diagnosed with diabetes which is a non-communicable disease. Therefore, they spend a large amount of money to treat it and sometimes take medicine for their whole life. As a result, they spend a great proportion of their income to get treatment. However; if they would be provided healthcare education and take necessary steps to avert such diseases, they can use their money for productive works. Thus, a proactive\u00a0approach to healthcare can lead to healthier population, which inturn contributes to the economic productivity of a country.\r\n\r\nMoreover, investing in health awareness system can significantly increase public awareness of healthy practices, thereby reducing the incidence of preventable ailments. However, many disorders are genetic and many infections are communicable for which the authorities should have to make prior plans. For example; during Covid pandemic many nations were not able to handle the cases because they did not have necessary plans. Thus, there should be adequate vaccinations and treatment plans to showcase the control of serious illness.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the authorities can aware people about the preventive measures to ensure their balanced life along with allocating treatment measures for serious malady for\u00a0comprehensive healthcare system.'",

For example,  when there is a ceremony such as a wedding or a funeral, everyone in the region helps and supports each other. As a result,  neighbours are happy for someone's happiness and they are sad for someone\u2019s sadness. Furthermore, the neighbourhood is the backrock of the relationships and communications. As a result, if you are depressed or need some support, you will find many loyal individuals around you, who advise you faithfully. Although, the reason for living in a birthplace may be property ownership, which decreases the expenses in renting in other places.\r\n\r\n However, growing up in the hometown has many advantages. For example, there are ready Connections and friendships, which serve the time in building new relationships. In addition, there is a supportive and safe environment for parents and children. For example, when we  were children, my mother told us that our home key would be with our neighbour, If she was outside. In contrast, living in the birthplace is terrible because sometimes, neighbours or relatives are nosy. Then they share with you about your personal life, or they visit without a previous appointment. In addition,  living where the individual was born engages them in gossip and rumours. Finally, the dominance  of the traditionals and customs, especially in the rural communities, may impact on the development of life skills. For instance, in rural life it's a shame if you apologise for visiting during  your exams or your children's exams.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people\u2019s hometown is the safe and supportive environment for raising children. On the other hand, some communities where an individual was born have positives.  Also they have drawbacks that may be an obstacle on the road of self-development and lead to bad issues.'",

Do the advantages of this develoment outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that young generation are living their homes in rural areas to study or work in cities. It is undeniable that getting education and experience becomes an essential part of our future. However, there is no absolute agreement as some people find moving to the cities in terms of development beneficial, while others especially their parents consider everything associated with living hometowns negatively. Surely there are both pros and cons about that situation but I believe advantages outweigh disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOne of the major positives of leaving countryside is that obviously, there are much more opportunities for personal growth and development in cities. For instance, there is no any qualified colleges or universities to become professional. So, in urban areas there are mane such institutions. Furthermore, after graduating young people have more convenience to find a job and gain first experience. Another advantage is that quality of infrastructure there is much higher than in small towns. A good example here is medicine. For instance, a person who has a toothache can easily make an appointment with a dentist and treat it on the same day.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the argument, it can lead to the urbanisation problem in whole country. Moreover, there is a risk of devastation of settlements. Yet, it is most likely that young people will return to their native lands after self-development.\r\n\r\nTaking everything mentioned into account, we can come to a conclusion that life in cities gives a lot of opportunities for personal growth , but it can also have consequences that need to be taken\u00a0into\u00a0account.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays it is very common to hear from people that it is hard for them to get sufficient sleep. As a result, they suffer from a lot of physical health problems as well as mental health issues. Therefore, making people aware of the detrimental effects of the lack of sleep and the importance of following the same sleep routine are the most effective solutions.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, good night\u2019s sleep is one of the most important factors for maintaining healthy lifestyle. Lack of good quality sleep can cause multiple problems not just in the short run but in the long run as well. Further, it has very harmful effects on the immune system of the body which helps fighting with diseases. Moreover, it increases the amount of stress in the body which in turn reduces the body\u2019s ability to recover itself. Consequently, this stress due to insufficient sleep leads to innumerable incurable diseases.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many possible solutions available which can help improve the sleep cycle. Among all, the first and foremost is to make people aware of the significance of enough sleep and how it can badly affect the overall health if not taken seriously. For example, most youngsters don\u2019t know about the adverse effects of lack of sleep and as a result, they don\u2019t pay much attention to it. Moreover, as per the study conducted by the Harvard research center, people who have the same sleep routine everyday are less susceptible to stress. Therefore, it is very important to have the same sleep routine.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, not getting adequate sleep can lead to a number of health problems and decrease the body\u2019s ability to cope up with stress. Spreading awareness about detrimental effects of lack of sleep and developing the sleep routine can definitely help solve the issues caused by it.'",

Do the advantages of this development outweigh its disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that students leaving rural areas to live in the cities. It is undeniable that urbanisation has become an essential part of our life. However there is no absolute agreement as some people find living in the city beneficial , while others consider everything associated with urban living negatively. Surely, there are both pros and cons to city life but I believe advantages outweigh disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOne of the main positives of city life is many entertainment options. In other words big cities are packed with museums, theatres, cultural attractions or other options. You can spend your free time as interesting and informative as possible.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is the medical assistance in the big cities. Getting good quality medical care is not a problem in urban areas. A good example here is the patient may not always receive the best care at a suburban medical facility, leading visiting doctors to recommend transferring them to a hospital in a city. Due to hospitals are outfitted with cutting-edge technology, a group of elite medical professionals, or first-rate services.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the argument, high living cost. Living costs in urban areas can be significantly higher compared to suburban or rural areas due to factors such as higher rent prices, increased cost of goods and services, and greater demand for amenities and conveniences. One clear example is  rent for a small apartment in the city center can easily exceed $3,000 per month, while the same amount may afford a spacious house in a suburban neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAnother major disadvantage is violence. Examples of violence in major cities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, such as interfaith clashes in Nairobi, and drug-related crime in Rio de Janeiro, are negative aspects of urban life, highlighting issues of safety and levels of violence that can significantly impact the quality of life and well-being of urban populations.\r\n\r\nHaving considered all the points mentioned, it is evident that urban living offers numerous advantages over suburban life. You just need to get out of the country as often as possible, visit nature to relax from the stressful\u00a0rhythm\u00a0of\u00a0life.'",

This may be the easiest and so the best way is to encourage people to purchase water motored and electric cars or at least obtaining vehicles with biodiesels will bring success.\r\n\r\nHaving weighed everything mentioned up, we can come to a conclusion that governors must stop manufacturing the oil. So it would not be surprising to see some shortages in using the ecological harmful agencies in the near future.

That is the avoidance of becoming a pollutant, which as we all know  protecting the environment by reducing a large amount of emissions from vehicles is always a topic that people are concerned about. By riding bicycles as the main transportation, people believe that the earth will be decreased a significant fuel fume each year that burning fuel vehicles are running which actually help our society we are living.

From my perspective, I think bicycles can not replace others . In this essay, I will discuss both views and explain my own opinion. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there is one primary reason why people think bicycles should be regarded as the main transport. That is the avoidance of becoming a pollutant, which as we all know  protecting the environment by reducing a large amount of emissions from vehicles is always a topic that people are concerned about. By riding bicycles as the main transportation, people believe that the earth will be decreased a significant fuel fume each year that burning fuel vehicles are running which actually help our society we are living. In addition to being friendly to the environment, those bikers think that using a bike will not cost too much money, and the insurance for cars, bills for oil or taxes for roads will be saved for other purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn spite of enormous advantages, using bicycles as the main vehicle also creates other problems such as taking too much time to move around, which others will be better especially to reach to far destinations. Besides, cycles will not cover entirely the environmental matters as well due to emissions only contributing a small proportion to the whole picture. With  modern technology, there are many new electric cars that are not only able to deal with environmental problems, but also faster and more effective than cycles. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, using bicycles as the main can help people save a large of money for running it and reduce emissions from vehicles, but it takes users too much time to go far points, and also can not tackle completely the environmental issues, which make using electric vehicles wiser.'",

These days most of people have a cellphone which has an undeniable role in our daily life, while human is a sociable and needs to have in person conversation rather than virtual one.

When humans, massively, move to a big city, they will contribute to the rising number of people working, learning, and living in the city. It will have a huge impact on cities population growth and result in a great amount of people in the city.

Thus, big town will be overly crowded and hard to handle. \r\n\r\nThe solutions referring to this problem are increasing job expectancies in the rural area and pursuing accommodations accessibility for everyone in the urban areas. Generally, when job opportunities are rising outside of big cities, the intentions will switch, for some people, to get a career in that area. So that, decreasing migration to the city and increasing movement to the rural area.

This choice has a number of benefits and drawbacks, which will be discussed in this essay.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity to study in a different city or even a country offers various advantages. First of all, moving out for studies is considered as a perfect way of separation from parents.  For instance, United States National Institute of Health stipulates that in spite of painful feeling a child might have, it is better to smoothly proceed to separate from caretakers at a young age starting from 18 years old. Moreover, it is the age of graduation from school in a number of countries, which is why it is a high time to decide whether to apply for a local higher education facility or try more challenging options. I believe that there are plenty of positive reasons. If a person travels for learning, they experience living in a new country, culture, make international friends and see popular sightseeings.

Certain individuals believe that sellers of such items are responsible whereas others opine that consumers should be considerate of using less packaged goods. This essay intends to shed light on both views and I have a divided opinion. \r\n\r\nTo Begin with, many wonderful facets are associated with the fact that selling lees packaged items is duty of merchant. The dominant is, brand image and getting repetative custumers. To be more specific, buyers who are concered about the impacts of excessive packing on the health and environment will incline towards the brands promoting the same. Therefore, clients will stick to the company for long-term and also will promote the brand by word of mouth.For an instanace, skin care manufacturers like Mama Earth and Derma co. encourage the concept of less packaging as a result these companies have highest number of repurchasing in the country. Futhermore, this can help the vendors to do cost saving. Precisely, when the manufacturers have to spend lesser resources on packing, they could invest the money into other sectors like marketing or enhancing the quality of the items. Eventually, lesser focus on product packaging can work in favour of the seller.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, accountability of customers in lowering the purchase of packed commodities can also not be overlooked. The contributing factor is environmental concerns. To elaborate, when demand of such articles gets reduced by the public due to its adverse consequences not only on surging the waste production, but also wastage of energy resources to produce packaging articles. The companies will lesser items in packing. Besides, lesser usage of packed products is also benefical for good health. To exaggerate, mostly plastic is used in the packaging of products. Due to, carcinogenic nature of the plastic it must be avoided at al costs. As a result, buyers have to be conscious that packed items are neither ideal for health nor for the environment.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I am inclined to believe that purchasing mindfully by the customers can be plausible factor in reduction of packaged items, but participation of sellers is also not ignorable.

This essay essay will delve into why sugar products should be expensive, along with related examples. \r\n\r\nFirstly, there are many health issues caused by cheaper and unhealthy products which usually contain high level of sugar. If sugary products are expensive, people generally will not buy them. This is because the price is often change customer behaviour, especially if it is expensive. For example, in Mongolia, fruits are expensive, apparently, not everyone cannot afford them. Instead of that most people consume fried dough which contains too much sugar.\r\n\r\nSecondly, majority of people do not know about the drawbacks of using too much sweety products. This is because high-level sugar can lead to addiction, such as craving more and more sugar when human organs eat sugar. If individuals had well awared about it, most people would not have comsumed comsumed products. For instance, young generation has becoming well understood the nutrition facts, as it is one part of subject in the secandary school. Consequently, youth generation likely to care their healthy being and fitness rather than previous generation. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, sugary products should be expensive, so that customer behaviour will change easily. Many people do not know about negative effect of consuming high-level sugar, so that increase awareness would be one of the important approach, which has already perceived within the youths because of secondary school started to teach this concept.'",

Surge in tourist numbers creates additional monetary value at the touristic destinations. For example, the tourism alone accounts for 20% of Turkey's entire economy, allowing them to divert these resources to the advancement of other sectors that  fell behind. In order to increase the number of visitors, touristic countries rigorously invest to develop their existing infrastructure as well as enhancing the leaving conditions of its employees. Furthermore, tourism promotes cultural exchange, allowing both visitors and hosts to learn about and appreciate different customs, traditions and ways of life. Resultantly, this mutual comprehension can foster global  connections and goodwill.\r\n\r\nDespite these benefits aforementioned above, tourism can also have adverse affects. First of all, as a direct result of tourism, each year many forests, parks and the entire flora and fauna are being destroyed by the increasing number of tourists. Moreover, due to the increased demand in the peak seasons, countries can be overwhelmed, falling short on accommodating tourists. Bearing in mind the influence of seasanality factor on the local markets, especially real-estate prices have been surged drastically, compelling natives to cope with these difficulties. \r\n\r\nwhile tourism offers a potential avenue for economic growth and cultural interaction, the scope of its drawbacks is expanding to a critical point, leading to significant increase in local markets and environmental pollution.'",

Mainly, that occurs because of two reasons: weakness in the content of studying materials and the unavailability of interesting activities in school. This essay will highlight the reasons for this situation and suggest some practical solutions that might increase the desire for education in students.\r\n\r\nFirstly, difficulty concentrating during class refers to a decrease in the attractive topics in the studying materials; therefore, the content of the subjects only includes scientific information; it does not contain different social topics or interesting experiences. Secondly, most schools give priority to education and do not give the same support to other activities such as sports,art,and cooking. To illustrate,the students spend longer hours in class than time in activities.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the education governments modify the content of subject material by adding topics and experiences that are interesting for the young generation. In addition, the design of the books, including pictures and colors, plays a significant role in attracting students. In other words,the schools should encourage the students to improve their hobbies and obtain many skills by creating a suitable environment and providing all the requirements and tools needed.\r\n\r\nTo sum up,we could say that students spend long hours in school; therefore, they should receive a high quality of education and improve their personalities at the same time.'",

This essay state that reduce environment pollution and traffic jam are main advantages while social gartering and lack of time management are the primary disadvantages. \r\n\r\nFirstly,  public transport help to reduce the environment pollution. If the public trasport are available then many people encourage to use this opportunity rather then private transport. For this,  when the amount of car are decreased in number it is possible to reduce the carbon footprint and safe the environment.  For example, research conduct with Social journal media in previous month and they found that the reduced of carbon dieoxide is caused by use private transport.  Furthermore, of the number of private transport  decrease then the traffic jam reduced very early because it occurs when too many vihcles run in one roads and parking road sides. So, it is the primary advantages that if majority of people use the public transport instead public transport, traffic jam and production od carbon dieoxide reduce gradually.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, social gattering and the time management are the disadvantages of public transport system. We see a primary example of bad impact of social gattering durion the pendamic in 2020 when the covid19 virus spread by the social gattering extremely.  Not only this,  there are chances to spread other virus disease in public transport as those are too gattering.  Moreover, time management of the public transport are the main issue.   A survey conduct by Star media news channel and most of the passengers said that they often ignore the public transport for poor time management as they use it for their work or office. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though the reduce of environment pollution and traffic jam is the advantages of public transport the drawbacks are time management and the social gattering which are occur by the public transport system.'",

While some people believe that many other environmental problems are in an emergency to due with.My stance is that biodiversity imbalance is not the most difficult problem of the world and the more important problems such as air pollution is an immediate provision.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is evidence suggesting how harm disappearing of several plants and animals is doing to the environment. This can be seen in the extinction of  natural habitats and many animal species due to deforestation and poaching, resulting in the disruption of the balance of nature and destabilization of ecosystems. Such problems, however, are caused by maladroit governments that either overlook the importance of the environment or the repercussions of their inaction because of a thriving economy.Thus, the environment could still be protected if government posed more strictly regulations such as hefty fines, sentenced individuals who break the laws to jails and encouraged organizations and citizens to raise fund open zoo to preserve rare animals or plant more trees.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that air pollution in cities is the most urgent threat all over the world. It might be caused by vehicle emission and industrial activities. For example, traffic congestion and the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles release pollutants such as carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. In addition, the process of manufacture and the activity of industry emit pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can,hence, harm the degradation of the environment ,causing climate changes.This is particularly true in the case of our today\u2019s earth where we suffer from various tremendous disasters such as flood, tsunami, earthquake and drought due to climate changes, directly affecting human life.These problems are way far earnest cause the governments can not forbidden people to transporting and halt manufacturing activities cause it will negatively affect the development of the world economy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the urgency of solving the loss of animals and plants to protect the  world\u2019s biodiversity, however, air pollution is more necessary for governments to tackle and to find solutions since it affects human life.'",

Museum  is one of them. One; they have workers who tirelesly make sure the place is well taken care of, therefore these workers need renumeration. Two; some museums keep live animals and these animal need food. Furthermore, there are also utility bills and other costs to be covered. All these are good enough reasons to allow museums charge entrance fees as means to finance some of their running expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as a national heritage site, it is grossly irresponsible to allow museums charge entrance fees to its citizens. What is going to happen to those who can not afford it is the biggest question, well, it means they are going to miss out on their greatest opportunity to reconnect with their history. Governments should fund these organisations and allow citzens to enter at free of charge. Moreover, the government should put a law that make foreigners pay to enter in local museums, whereby all local people should produce IDs to enter for free.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is important to note that museums are very important to educate our community about the local environment whether about the past or present.

Further, they should provide ransom of money to farm workes, so they will not migrate to other towns to look for work as well as provide best quality of farm equipment with a very little price this will motivate the farmers\r\n\r\nin doing farming.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are several consequences such as rise in the price of food products and war against each other by nations if folks from agricultural background drops in number.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is think by some people that politicians are more influential than scientists where other believe that scientists influence more than politicians. This essay elaborate both sides and agree with that scientists are more influential than politician.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is argued that scientists have more influence than other. They are creators in all modern technology, modern science though they have no supernatural power to manipulate people but they influence over us by creating amazing technology. For example, in modern era's children it is a common dream to be a engineer or works on technology,it is a great influenced by the scientist there explored power influence today's young generation. Moreover, almost every ages people do not pass a single moment without scientifical things or gadgets, our society depends on it , so it is also a image of influencers. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people think that politician are more influencer than scientists. Though politics leader give speech influence people but they give it particular one group of people not every ages. For example, people of all ages can not allow to participate in votes and they give their speech only one purpose or political related which is influenced one particular group or matured group of people. Furthermore, it is true that politicians have influencer power but it works on those people who are matured enough and understand politics or social rules. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, politicians have influence by their speech or political work one particular group of people while scientists have also influenced people on every ages by their creations and my opinion is scientis are more influence than politicians.'",

While there are some benefits high-income families for helping low and middle-income class especially for food and education, I believe the governments should have authority to provide basic needs for society themselves. \r\n\r\nA wealthy family is able to help poorer citizens by providing their money  for essential service such as education and food. For example, they are able to giving scholarship for poorer families through their foundation. Another things richest families can do is by provide basic food for low-income family such as milk, rice, eggs etc that provide several vitamins for their health. The high income family can allocate for example 3-5% from their profit for poorer families. Despite the ability to share weatiness\u2019s families for poorer, I do believe it was not a mandatory things. It would be wise, if helping poorer citizens is a choice not a mandatory.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the one who responsible to ensure basic need for poorer citizens is a governments body. The government has authority to regulate policy that can support poorer citizens to access basic needs. The government also has right to manage nations taxes, which was affected for poorer families. For example, the government have right to increase richest families taxes, and allocate it for meet basic life of society on their nations. The government can held a program that pro with poorer citizens by giving, for example, free tuition fees for all poorer families in all degree of education and others social assistance programs that increase wellbeing life.   \r\n\r\nTo sump up, helping poorer family is a choice for richest family - not a mandatory.

As society develops it is increasingly seen as an uncivilized activity and caused to helpless animals that are killed. All blood sports should be banned. Discuss the main arguments for this statement \\u0026 give your opinion' \n 'Text': 'Sports which involve animals were quite popular in the ancient times. It is a debtable topic that society considers bloodsports a cruel act as animals are harmed and killed just for the sake of entertainment. So it is suggested that a complete ban should be imposed on this activity. Well, I personally believe this given viewpoint and this essay will highlight the backing reasons in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe foremost reason why animal sports should be banned is that animals have the right to live on the earth. In the past times, this activity was extremely popular among royalities to showcase their power and competitions for bull fighting had been held between various groups which led to lots of blood shed among animals. Even if, many people were concerned about this act but kings and princes of those times were not willing to leave this sport and eventually animals would slowly gave up on life while enduring pain during the competitions. Thus, bloodsports are not only against the rights of animals but also its highly painful for the innocent creatures so it should be banned properly.\r\n\r\nMany birds which are involved in the game are on the verge of extinction is the another reason why such sport events should be prohibited. In London, the famous sport was to hung the bird on rope and the king while riding on the horse would snatch the hanging bird but this activity led to the extinction of some birds such as goose. Also, extensive fishing has elevated the risk of extinction of some fish species which in turn will disturb the life cycle of the earth. Therefore, the more the control on these sports, the lesser the birds and aquatic animals would disappear.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it can be inferred that no doubt, blood sports is a uncultured act of the society. Nonetheless, animals have equal rights as of humans to live on this earth and the endangered species can be saved by blocking this sports so that these creatures could be saved.'",

FOR SOME REASON, VIDEO GAMES BECOME PART OF OUR LIVES AND PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT THE HARM OF VIDEO GAMES. IN MY OPINION THE NEGATIVE EFFECT CAN OUTWEIGH THE POSITIVE ONES. HOWEVER.THIS ESSAY WILL DISCUSS BOTH SIDES OF VIDEO GAMES AND TRY TO DRAW A CONCLUSION. \r\n\r\nFIRST OF ALL, IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES OF VIDEO GAMES ARE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. VIDEO GAMES CREATORS CAN CREATE AN AMAZING GAMES THAT PUBLIC TEND TO ADDICT. SPEACIALLY, OVER HALF OF THE USER IS CHILDREN. DUE TO VIDEO GAMES ADDICTION, CHILDREN CAN NOT CONTROL THEIR FEELINGS OR SPEND THEIR FREETIME PRODUCTIVE. THEY ARE SITTING BEHIND THEIR TABLE FOR A LOT OF TIME JUST PLAYING GAMES. WHEN CHILDREN ARE TOO ADDICTED VIDEO GAMES, PARENTS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO STOP THEM. IN ADDITION TO THIS, MOST IMPORTANTLY, PARENTS SHOULD KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN PLAYING. FUTHERMORE THEY CAN PREVENT RISKS OR ANY BAD HABITS. ON THE INTERNET THERE ARE HUGE EFFECTIVENESS OF VIDEO GAMES. THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF GAMES. MOST LIKELY, YOUNG CHILDREN LIKE TO PLAY KILLING GAMES BECAUSE GETTING A SATISFACTION THEY NEVER HAD IN THEIR REAL LIFE. AS THE DAMAGE OF KILLING GAMES, ADDICTED CHILDREN LIKE TO PLAY REAL KNIVES OR GUNS THEREFORE THERE IS HIGH CHANCE OF COMMITTING A CRIME ACCIDENTALLY. \r\n\r\nTURNING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGMENT, E-SPORT IS ONE OF THE SPORTS THAT PARENTS HAVE TO ALLOW. ALL AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE TONS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE GETTING MONEY FOR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. ONE OF THEM HAS BECOME A BILLIONARE. THEY ARE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND STREAMING IT THROUGH THE YOUTUBE, AND GETTING DONATIONS FOR THEIR FANS. SO THAT, IT IS A ONE WAY OF MAKING MONEY EASILY.  ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF PLAYING VIDEO GAMES IS NETWORKING WITH FOREIGN PEOPLE. THUS, WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING THEY CAN ALSO LEARN NEW LANGUAGES OR NEW SKILLS AT THE SAME TIME. \r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, VIDEO GAMES ARE REALLY FUN TO RELIEVE STRESS AND DEPRESSION, BUT IF PUBLIC GET ADDICTED TO MUCH AS WELL AS THEY CAN GET STRESSED AND DEPRESSED BECAUSE OF THEIR SURRENDER. IN MYB VIEW OF THIS POINT, CHILDREN AND PARENTS HAVE TO KNOW THEIR LIMITS OF PLAYING VIDEO GAMES UNLESS THEY WILL GET IN BIG TROUBLE.

This essay completely agree with this statement because publicly smoking effects other health besides the smoker and children may attract on this if adult people smoke toward them.\r\n\r\nFirstly, smoking not only effect a smokers health but also other peoples besides him. Though a smoker affected by many health problems but this problem is as same as for other people indirectly. For example, a general statement we always see that smoking is injuries to health . It mainly damaged the lungs especially a smokers and a children's lung. Moreover, if anyone smoke toward other people though it is normal for a smoker and few person but it may disappointed for others and many suffers from azma, oxygen problems and other diseases.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, children may attract by a smoker to smoking. As everyone know that children reveals their curiosity for a thing very early and attract soon. So , if anyone especially adults smoke in front of them , they may question about it , they being intersted what thing is it and by this smoking attracted the children which does not give good impact in our next generation. For example, if parents smoke toward their baby , they learn it from their parents and compare it as a normal or good thing because children always follow their parents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the decision compare as a good and I agree with this because by ban publicly smoking children do not attract in it besides smoking effects everyone's health which is decreased now.'",

Although, these should be doing in limitation and in humane as much as possible to prevent extinction of certain species of animals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, almost animals have the same vital organs with mankind, so it is really helpful to utilize animals in experimentation.

In my opinion, I believe that it is best to give children freedom to choose free-time activities because it can improve their self-confidence. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the management of free-time activity among children must be handled by parents in order to not waste children\u2019s potentials. Generally, when a child tries to select particular activities to fill their leisure time, the decision underpins from either the conformity towards their friends or they just want to have fun. As a result, children will not learn to acknowledge their area of interests as well as fully develop their potential. If parents are taking role to arranged their free-time activities; however, those risks can be alleviated. It can be seen among South Korean parents, who mostly contribute in arranging their children\u2019s leisure activities, since they do not want to waste prominent resources that can alleviate their child\u2019s competencies, enabling them possess useful skills when entering higher educational stages. Regarding this notion, nevertheless, I do not think this method can benefit children in the long run because it can cause lack of independency toward themselves. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, giving offsprings the liberty to decide their pursuits during spare time can help them to improve self confidence. Entrusting children with their own choices subliminally prompts them to believe in their abilities. A 2018 research by Anna Freud Centre revealed that the consequences from autonomous parents who gave their children opportunities to choose their additional activities during school breaks, causing greater improvements in their self confidence that consecutively preserve until their secondary school period. Meanwhile, those who had their parents tried to take control over all their educational and non-educational schedules ended up felt inferior, and deemed to doubt their competencies. Reflecting from this view; therefore, I support the idea to enable children having their own dependency to choose kind of activities that they want to perform during leisure time since it can embark positive characteristics that maintains for the long-term. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although parents-centered managements of leisure activities benefits children to not waste their potential, I think this method slowly deters them to be fully independent toward themselves. Therefore, I support the belief to give more liberty toward children in order to prompt their positive attributes, which can be useful in the long-term'",

As a result, free of cost service could not save the future presence of these places.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, museums  that charge money from public are well-maintained and preserved by the state or private authorities. The positive impact of this will be that these will be available to the future generations and provide understanding of the past effectively. Despite the positive impacts of charging payment, it could increase burden on public for its maintenance. In a nutshell, it is overall positive practice.'",

In my opinion, this might affect people in daily life because paper money will be replaced by cards or online process. Furthermore, some people will be unsatisfied because of hard method and paying heavy taxes.\r\n\r\nNowadays, some countries use card or phone payments instead of cash since the internet access is usually widely available. Firstly, some governments require reducing the costs of producing banknotes. This is the reason why the governments encourage commercial banks to adopt cashless systems such as online platforms or card payments. Moreover, governments are able to examine the income of the population from bank accounts. As a result, the government can gain more tax income of tax from this process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the elderly generation who lack access to technology do not understand how to use cashless payments. Additionally, underdeveloped countries have populations who are unbanked or underbanked, such as Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. Furthermore, tax avoidance decreases when people have to use the cashless system due to government examination of bank accounts. For example, bank account books are being replaced by mobile banking applications or bank websites, and instead of paying with banknotes, people will pay with cards or mobile phones.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, cashless payment is already present in some countries, and this trend is expected to increase dramatically in the future. Online platforms and card payments are replacing paper money with government support. However, the majority of people in underdeveloped countries do not have access to convenient payment methods.'",

While traditional group exercise class and team sports remail popular, personalized fitness programs delivered by dedicated trainers are becoming increasingly sought after. This shift can be attributed to several factors.\r\n\r\nFirstly, modern life is often characterized by busy schedules and a lack of free time. Personal trainer offer a solution, arranging workout routines to fit individuals need and time constraints. This eliminates the need for lengthy commutes to gyms or fixed class timetables which makes exercise more accessible.\r\n\r\nSecondly, personal trainers cater to specific goals and limitations.  Unlike general gym routines of group classes, weaknesses and injuries are personally designed for each person. This approach can lead to faster progress and reduce risks of workout-related injuries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reliance on personal trainer also presents potential drawbacks. Regular group exercise can encourage a sense of community and motivation which absents in one-on-one sessions. The social interaction in team sports or group classes can be the key factor in maintaining long-term exercise commitment. Additionally, the cost of personal training can be barrier to many, potentially widening the gap in access to fitness quality.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the rise of hiring personal trainers caters to demand of hectic lifestyles and offer customized fitness plans.

This essay agrees that art and culture is a unique identity of the nation and government must allocate some funds to preserve them.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, art and culture represent the country in the whole world, and the global reputation of any nation is determined by its rich culture. For example, India is well known for its culture of unity in diversity, hence, most countries believe that India is open in terms of accepting new ideas. Furthermore, global image of any country is very significant factor in terms of maintaining relations with other countries.

Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary era, people tend to maintain relations with their friends and acquaint themselves with the news through socializing platforms available over the internet. I think its advantages are far more appealing than the disadvantages that will be examined further in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, social media is much more interactive than print media or any other communication sources of the past decades. At first, these are convenient and speedy ways through which information can be analyzed and news can be heard. As compared to present, the media was slower in the past and only provided news on the next day of the incident which reduces the urgency of the issue. However, these days news are spread so quickly on the internet that it demonstrates the urgency and even people take necessary actions to avoid future consequences of any negative news. For instance, nowadays, during the epidemic of corona virus, people were provided with safety measures to prevent the spread which was not possible during bygone eras of print media. Apart from this, the different social networking apps are crucial tools to coordinate with people at work. For instance, gmail helps to convey the messages to different people at work or even the personal messages which are quicker than mails or postal letters.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some of the disadvantages could affect the overall positive impact of these platforms. One such shortcoming is spread of negative news at a speedy way which can result in numerous bad effects in the society. To illustrate it, the news of discrimination with a black man turned into riots and the spread of information too fast became problematic to the general public. Consequently, in some cases, it can face criticism from some sections of society also.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the positive prospects of the social media use will continue in the future. The numerous upsides of quick access to knowledge at just one click bring about faith in technology. Although, it fails to adhere to such results in some situations. In a nutshell, the positive aspects outweighs the drawbacks of the socializing platforms.'",

Reasons with examples' \n 'Text': 'If someone is selfish at his job then he might get promoted better than others. I believe that this is not true and there are many reasons behind that which will be examined further in the essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, an individual cannot work as a team player if he only proceeds with his personal agendas at work. This can cause numerous drawbacks for a team and success is only determined when people get along with others at work and contribute in a positive way rather than only having interest in their individual plans. So, a person can never achieve success when his team lag behind all the targets set by their boss. For example, a team divides all of their job responsibilities among the workers to share their work load. If an individual fails to perform a task then other one have to take the responsibilty for his teammate's work otherwise it could lead to problems in the future. Thus, an organization fails to grow when a team lacks unity and prosperity never comes to that work place. Overall, an individual cannot succeed with that kind of mindset.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, if an individual's personal interests continues at work then it turns more totalitarian than a democratic workplace. The workplace will never be able to retain some of the talented employees at work if someone who is just selfish will be rewarded and others will find it discrimination to their hardwork and determination. Eventually, the self-centered individuals will never contribute towards the success of the firm. It could lead to the failure of a company. For instance, if a salesperson is selfish then he will never divide an equal share of profits between his colleagues and his company and their income will never rise and they could leave the company because of such behaviour.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the self-centered individuals do not have the ability to work as a team member and support other colleagues at work. Apart from this, it may turn a job site into an unrealistic and undemocratic in nature.'",

What solution can you suggest?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad behaviour among students. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricker rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aim to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, in which they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate on online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events cause momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there are the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screentime, internet availibilty or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home cause poor manners at school. Yet if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school.'",

In the next paragraphs, I will delve into the main reasons in their detail.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, competitive sports generate a fundament for an improvement in the field during adolescence. Many people have a character such as ambition and competing with others in their youth term. Competition in sports is the best method to manage these characteristics. That is, competitive games play can lead to a beneficial rivalry. If teenagers acquire successes resulted from their exercises in any sports competition, this will create self-confidence for them. They will believe that everything can be gained with exercises, after once a win. Consequently, this will induce a positive influence on their education. As for me, their strong belief after their win in the competition will be reflected in their education and bring about educational success.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ambitious behaviours which take out during the adolescent term can be harmful to teenagers. Sometimes they get so caught up in ambition that any loss or misfortune in the competition leads to hopelessness and the loss of self-belief. Furthermore, some teenagers apply to wrong methods which are not suit for the right competition in sports racing because of this ambition for acquiring. Consequently, extreme ambitions can create unjustified competition among teenagers, and all these can cause bad results in the development of their personalities. What`s more, all these will affect the worst the education of teenagers in the future, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, according to me, both ideas are respectful. Competitive sports can be beneficial in the adolescent term because these generate aims and determinations, and eventually, these will also create positive effects on teenager`s education. However, the extreme ambition level can be harmful to their education because such a level may reflect badly on the development of their personality.'",

This phenomenon could be attributed to both generation gap and cutting-edge technology, which would not smooth out only by parenteral restrictions.\r\n\r\nAccording to my point of view, the most important reasons why youngesters do prefer their friends instead of their families, is the generation gap between them and their parents. Unfortunately, parents do not feel the nessecity to over come this, which is why it is getting worse as time goes on. The second most important reason is that the youth tend to be technophiles, whereas the aged seems to be technophobes, which is an aggrevating factor for the generation gap. For example, most parents are not able to use online platforms.\r\n\r\nThere are some measures that could be taken to overcome this problem. For instance, parents should start to socialise with their children as much as they can, and make progress in all fields necessary to overcome the problem of generatin gap. Taking the example of technology, parents should start to learn how to use up-to-the-minute technology gadgets, and even learn computer coding, as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are various factors which endangers relations in families and the two most important of which are generation gap and technology. which could be solved if all family members took appropriate solutions such as spending more time together through innovative methodes and not being affraid of technology and new devices.'",

For instance, students who participate in these classes can be attracted by these kind of activities, as a result of it, students may ignore other subjects in order to show great performances and enhance their skills related to these fields.

To exemplify, students need breaks and refresh their minds between tiring classes to concentrate on each subject well, while some can do it easily during the breaks, for others engaging in physical activities can be more effective as it promotes some individuals with a sense of fulfilment, relaxation and being away from the stress. Additionally, naturally gifted students can gain experience and improve their skills by attending these kinds of branches.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after being manifested both points, while some people are convinced that the subjects which are not related to academic studies should be eliminated from the list of subjects, I am absolutely against to this attitude.

The most notable observation from this change is the increased number of individuals with obesity. This trend is predominantly caused by alternative food options that results in a poor diet, which can cause numerous medical implications. Hence, this essay will examine the cause and effect of obesity. \r\n\r\nAlternative food options like fast food restaurants or pre-cooked meals can be a convenient and time saving option, however these options will most likely cause obesity when misused.   For example, one meal at McDonalds contains more calories than the average amount of calories an individual is recommended to consume daily. Moreover, most supermarkets nowadays sell pre-cooked meals that are unfortunately stacked with preservatives that can also lead to obesity. Thus, fast food restaurants and ready meals cause a poor diet, which gives rise to obesity. \r\n\r\nObesity can put enormous amounts of stress on the health of an individual. For instance, the medical board at Montana Hospital recently found that 80% of the cardiovascular patients at the hospital are overweight. Given this, patients with heart diseases, due to obesity, are often accompanied with knee and back problems. Hence, there are serious medical effects that can hinder a person when overweight. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, fast food restaurants and pre-cooked meals can contribute to a poor diet, which will result in obesity if used excessively.

Given this, they can be in the form of an antique heritage site or a modern state of the art building. Museums can serve for a number of reasons, but it is largely attributed for its contribution to education and entertainment. \r\n\r\nFirstly, museums have the ability to showcase centuries of history in one setting.

Additionaly, such educational museums can be extremely beneficial for learners who have learning disibilties, given that almost all learning styles are met during such programs.

From my perspective, an ageing population does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nI recognize that people living longer can have some advantages. Specifically, the elderly often possess traditional skills, which are symbols of traditional culture. If older people pass away at a young age, the youth may lose the opportunity to learn these skills or methods from them. For instance, many traditional African living devices and skills are being lost nowadays because the locals die at a young age, and young residents such as children or teenagers have no chance to learn.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is true that the potential by-products of this phenomenon are adverse impacts on the public, and they overtake the benefits. This is because an ageing population signifies a reduction in the social labor force, which is a necessary part of our society. For example, in some countries, there are more and more elderly residents, as a result, their countries\u2019 productive forces are declining. The loss of productive force may cause a financial crisis or other difficulties. Moreover, an ageing population could put significant pressure on governments, such as addressing health and policy problems. It is obvious that most elderly individuals\u2019 physical conditions are worse than those of younger people. To solve this problem, the government has to spend more money on health facilities, resulting in less investment in other aspects that are crucial for a country\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, every coin has two sides, and so does the ageing population. Nevertheless, the advantages are relatively minor compared to the multiple disadvantages. Thus, I believe that an ageing population brings more cons than pros.'",

The members of the staff need to know the fact that the people who have major roles in the work care about them and what they do. The employment needs to make the workers believe that they want them to improve and get better. If not paying for the sustained teaching and training which can be impactful for the potential trainees` improvement , they may start losing their hope for the work and eventually quit. What the wage does is to strengthen the relationship between all individuals working for the field as they can count on each other more.\r\n\r\nSome people argue that It is the employee`s duty to deal with the financial part of their continuing instruction for the independence of the institute .It has been believed that getting better in a position depends on the will and the actions of the person who does the career. If  necessary , training should be done by the potential trainees even with  financial barriers. Thus It is said to have affected their level of self-reliance. However, I think cash by the individual cannot be a bridge for an improvement as it weakens the communication and the cooperation of the staff. It is  common knowledge that progression in business can be seen by teamwork and the level of trust.  Consequently, members of staff can't bring anything to the table for progression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion , I am not convinced that staff should be responsible for giving award to train as it has a negative effect on cooperation which is a key role for every profession.

Do you think is it a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'In recent years more and more people opt for surgeries to change something about their appearance. This is due to the fact that social media created some beauty standards that are hard to achieve, and also because medicine has improved so much that now individuals can modify almost anything about their looks.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we now live in an age where social media apps, like Instagram or TikTok, are part of our day-to-day life, and people with a large number of followers have become influencers. They usually consist of men or women that are considered attractive by the society that the live in, thus creating some beauty standards that their followers would want to achieve so that they can be or look like them, this way becoming beautiful in the eyes of everyone. Unfortunately, a fact not known by a lot of people is that the majority of influencers edit their pictures to hide their imperfections, so the standard they are creating is fake and not realistic, and it can create mental health problems for the followers that can not afford to achieve it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the beauty standards created by the society are more and more demanding, and every little imperfection can cause a normal individual to not feel good about themselves. The improvement of medicine and technology now allows people to remove their moles, create dimples, remove wrinkles, lose weight, create \u2018hip-dips\u2019 or create the so-called \u2018fox eyes\u2019, following every beauty trend that appears once in a while and achieving a perfect face or body, in the eyes of social media.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, i believe that the beauty standards implied by influencers and social media are unhealthy for people, and that they should resort to cosmetology surgery only if they truly feel that the change they are going to do will make them truly happy.'",

Making a good career and creating a competitive edge over colleagues are the biggest advantage while mental health issues and developing bad habits are the primary disadvantages of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, nowadays competition in the job market is fierce, and it is very difficult for employees to get promotion or find a job with a good salary. Therefore, to sustain the job they have and to get a raise, workers often choose to work beyond their regular job hours. Consequently, employees who show more dedication towards their job by working for long hours, create a competitive edge over their colleagues. For example, as per the recent study, most managers tend to have a positive image for employees who work after job hours. \r\n\r\nAlthough working for more hours is advantageous for better career prospects, it shouldn\u2019t be prioritized at the cost of leisure and fun activities. To explain in detail, leisure activities like light exercise, going for small trips, spending quality time with family all have a significant impact on physical and mental well being. Since many people suffer from mental health issues due to long working hours, they start smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol to cope with the stress. This is why, working for long hours is not recommended when mental and physical health get compromised.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though spending extended hours at work may increase the chances of getting promoted or getting a pay raise, its adverse effects on mental and physical health should be taken into consideration while deciding to work for long hours. Additionally, developing the habit of drinking and smoking to reduce the stress at work is never a good option either in the short run or in the long run.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Museums and Town halls are becoming part of the society nowadays. Some individuals claim that, it is beneficial to construct modern museums and town buildings other than renovating the outmoded ones. I strongly agree that new museums should be built as it will provide more space and include modern architecture which will be accessible to visitors and also great jobs for the community. \r\n\r\nThere are many advantages of building museums and town centres. Firstly, the construction of new facilities incorporates modern design and technology and providing more accessible space. This attracts tourists as they are intrigued by the design and will like to explore the area as there will facilities for visitors to enjoy their stay at the museum. For instance, the building of Kwame Nkrumah historical museum in Ghana included great artifacts and has increased its amenities to include many modern departments such as the library, restaurants, exhibition halls etc. Also, due to its expansion and facility, many local people have been employed in various fields and this has reduced the unemployment rate. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people affirm that the old museum should be renovated because they believe renovating the old buildings will help maintain historical continuity and preserve cultural heritage. They believe that the history there will be lost when they are destroyed hence, keeping it with slight change is the best. In addition, it is believed that, preserving old buildings can foster a sense of identity. New generation will know their linage as the same history will be passed down to them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, construction of new museums and town halls opens enormous advantages to local residents and should be encouraged even though preserving historic buildings help keep cultural heritage and foster a sense of identity in the community.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those which are done alone. Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'While some argue that group or team activities offer valuable life skills, I firmly disagree with this assertion. Because I believe that individual endeavours can impart equally, if not more, important life skills.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, proponents of group activities often highlight the collaborative nature of such endeavours, suggesting that they cultivate teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. For example, working in a team setting can provide individuals with opportunities to learn how to cooperate, delegate tasks, and resolve conflicts effectively. This is mainly because group activities often simulate real-life scenarios where individuals must navigate diverse perspectives and work towards common goals.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is essential to recognise that solo pursuits also offer invaluable life lessons. Undertaking tasks alone fosters self-reliance, independence, and accountability, all of which are crucial skills for navigating various aspects of life. While working independently, individuals must rely on their own judgement, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance to overcome challenges, in contrast to the approach of group activities. This self-reliance not only instills confidence and resilience but could also empower individuals to tackle obstacles with determination and resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nA further advantage, somewhat related to the one mentioned above, is that solo activities provide opportunities for deep introspection and personal growth. When working alone, individuals do have the freedom to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and discover their strengths and weaknesses without external influences. This self-discovery is especially integral to developing a strong sense of identity and purpose, thereby laying the foundation for personal fulfilment and success in life. In addition, individual pursuits often require a high degree of focus and concentration, so  honing essential skills such as time management, organisation, and critical thinking is equally important. \r\n\r\nIn summarising up, although group activities undoubtedly offer valuable opportunities for collaboration and interpersonal development, I contend that solo endeavours can teach equally important life skills. Self-reliance, independence, personal growth, and critical thinking are just a few examples of the invaluable skills that individuals can acquire through individual pursuits. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that group activities are superior to imparting essential life skills.'",

It supports the idea of abuse in lots of families in each country of the world, thieves don't need a reason for doing their crimes, but they totally have it on why they became like this. Eventually after abuse and not mentally stable people in life, the person can start to feel okay with doing something wrong, especially illegal. In addition to this, people through a lot of centuries tried to develop the police system, and as I see this situation it didn't really help in reducing crime in the world, because of lots of illegal businesses, millionaires, and billionaires who didn't under control of government and police, and the reason is money, also an opportunity on using weapons legally, etc. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I think people should have mental help, and the system doesn't need to punish those people physically, but instead work on their thoughts and find a reason for their crimes this way.'",

Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Whether the outcome of resisting a training course is a well-qualified educator or not is a controversial discussion point. This writer agrees that academic years are not ideal to indicate good teachers but it must be considered about their experiences and personalities.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be acknowledged that being a skilful teacher not only requires a good training lesson but also the experiences he or she has. It is obvious that a teacher has to be in charge of many other things relating to students rather than only teaching. To be more specific, a good teacher must know how to talk with students, and listen to their feelings in order to help them get further at school. For instance, teachers in LTT have to be really experienced in helping students since students have to deal with a huge amount of stress frequently.\r\n\r\nHowever, some individuals believe that the most important factor that decides how well a teacher is is the program they resist. This belief might stem from the competitive job opportunities where schools are more focused on their employee's academic training courses. This might be true, but if teachers are only good at teaching and not well-equipped with communication skills, they will not be able to guide their class further because students also need mental support. As a result, their class will not make any progress and reduce the quality of future employees.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this essay argues that teachers personalities must also be taken into account. Yet, being exceptional at teaching but lacking of emotional side can have a negative impact on the whole class. To be clear, teachers have to be extremely patient so that they can understand  how their students are doing in class. Take NK as a contextual example, teachers here are trained with their patient skills due to the fact that many students have different studying paces.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a good training program is not the most suitable way to consider someone as a good teacher but it must also be for their teaching experiences and personalities.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each situation?' \n 'Text': 'One of the most prevalent trends in the contemporary world is the cumulative increase in relocation of students from one city to another or abroad for their higher studies. The argument whether it is beneficial for children to spend their life away from their parents for education has been gathering momentum across the world in recent times. It is completely agreed that a quality education is must to shape one's life and for this, some folks leave their homes and move to another place and spend their life in the absence of their family. I will provide an overview on both advanvtages and disadvantages of this notion and will reach into a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, when folks will live outside of their house, they will get chance to learn new skills everyday from their peers and it will be easy for them to mould according to different situations in their life in future when they will get marry and manage family and work life as living away will make them more independent and they will be responsible for their household chorus such as cooking, cleaning and managing their finances. Moreover, scholars will be able to enhance their interpersonal skills by taking part in social activities in universities, by joining different student clubs which in turn will increase the social network of pupils. For example, in hostel life, it is very easy to learn basic living rules such as get up early in the morning as one has to wait in the queue to take shower and for breakfast. It teaches folks to maintain daily routine, sense of sharing and keep patience while waiting in the queue for meals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, staying at home has its own benefits as one can learn from the parents or ancestors. Emotional support is must during university life as some students feel stressed due to pressure of study and they feel embarrased to discuss with their peers or teachers which has given birth to many suicides in the past. Furthermore, living at home while studying can help to save money on accommodation and food and provide substantial financial relief to parents. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I believe that it is important to stay away from home while studying as it helps masses to participate in late night group activities or group studies happen in universities as it give chance to learn in more effective way rather than sitting alone and learning in the home.'",

The argument whether all four skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing) are equally important has been gathering momentum across the world in recent times. It is completely agreed that all these four skills are important when someone wants to survive where that language is used as nationwide. This stance will be proven by carefully analysing the benefits of all these four modules in day-to-day life of humans.\r\n\r\nFirstly, one has to put a lot of efforts to learn reading and writing as they are very important to handle daily activities of life. Moreover, reading is an essential part and plays a big role when someone wants to sign any agreement or contract whereas writing makes it happen as it is not possible to make these documents without the knowledge of writing. For example, it is hard to understand the bills and buy basic groceries if someone is not able to read.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, effective listening is a way to know the feelings of mankind and it is impossible to communicate without it. In addition to this, speaking is the primary part to convey your message to others and nobody can work without it. Moreover, it is quite necessary to ask for help in hard situations and one cannot make it without talking.

They claim that paper based tests are the best way because, all the students will be examined in a same and fair condition. Moreover, high quality exams are consist of different types of questions such as multiple choices and essay tasks that give test-takers almost enough information about each individual student.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, people who oppose this kind of assessment argue that, students have different intellectual capacities and they should not be judged merely by taking paper exams.

Let's take my country as an example, Rural residents moving from other provinces account for 3.38% of the urban population.  Compared to the period 2004-2009, the proportion of migration flow from rural to urban areas increased (44.2% compared to 30.5%), the proportion of migration flow from urban areas to urban areas decreased from 34.0%.  6% to 14.9%. Just over 5 years, the demonstration by number changed too much. \r\n\r\nNext, like I said I don't think this increase has much more benefit. Depend on economically speaking, greatly affects the use of labor and resource exploitation, in some places there is a surplus, in some places there is a shortage of labor. About Socially: causes many problems such as traffic congestion, wealth gap, theft, social evils....etc. The most special is grey drainage which is difficult to solve occurs by the government. On the other hand,  the  government' s responsibility in this truth is very large. They need to improve material facilities and increase more jobs in the countryside,...etc. \r\n\r\nFinally, this is an unfavorable situation for the long term. Therefore, the government and each indidual need to equip themselves with thinking and keansyres to overcome this unfortunate disparity. \r\n\r\nIn short, this is an unfavorable situation for the long term.  Therefore, the government and each individual need to equip themselves with thinking and measures to overcome this disparity.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In recent years, people have preferred that riding bicycles to driving a car. There are tons of benefits and drawbacks of using bicycles as a main form of transport. in this essay, i will look at both sides and try to draw a conclusion. \r\n\r\nLet's begin by looking at the advantages of using bicycles. First of all, riding a bicycle regularly makes us more fit and healthy, because we move our muscles every way of our motion when we are riding a bicycle. Another outstanding point is save our time and cost of living. for example, in Mongolia there is a high traffic jams everyday, thus riding a bicycle can prevent us from heavy traffic jams. As well as, we spend some of money for transportation. For taxi, every meters costs money and for public transportation it is much cheaper than the taxi, however, public transportation can be uncomfortable at all. In addition to this, we spend much time to park our cars whereas bicycles are easy to park because of its size. Individuals that use cars, it can be expensive to buy cars and for using this car require fuels therefore, it causes unplanned expense.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the argument, riding a bicycle can cause unemployment for every sector. For example, the company that makes cars can be in danger.  if public keen on bicycles more than cars, company's income can be gone down. Furthermore, engineering and mechanics lose their job due to bicycle usage. Also, drivers will lose their customers and public transportations too. so that, the government can be in danger either. Another disadvantage of riding bicycle is unsafe, the reason is the weather changing and precipitation. For example, in Mongolian unexpected weather changing, bicycles cause accidents and the cars would be more suitable for long distance travel.\r\n\r\nTo wrap things up, the benefits of using bicycles outweigh the drawbacks of using bicycles. In my point of view, public have to use bicycles as much as they can. It can affect our well being, age and finance.'",

Another reason is that  natural disasters can happen anywhere and helping each other is a necessary humanilsm trait to create better relationship and bring a peace in the global.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, wealthy nations tend to have more developed health care systems which include high skilled and knowledgeable professionals. natural disaster can produce a lot of injured people and they often requires quality health care which allows to save so many citizens. For examples, I have joined non-profit organisation which gathers health care professions such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists from over the world to help people who suffered from the massive floods in Indonesia few years ago.

Consequently, if people do not take steps towards owing a house, they will never afford it.

How could this trend affect our environment and the kinds of jobs required?' \n 'Text': 'It is true that the popularity of online shopping is experiencing a significant surge. This essay will show its far-reaching negative and positive impacts on the environment and on various jobs related to e-commerce.\r\n\r\nThe increase of online shopping brings both positive and negative impacts on the environment. This trend has helped minimise emissions and fuel consumption by decreasing the number of private vehicles traveling to traditional stores, thereby contributing to improving the air pollution. Nevertheless, remote purchasing also leads to a rise in packaging waste as this method often links with the process of product transportation, which requires careful packaging with multiple layers such as shock-absorbent wraps, cardboard boxes, to protect goods. This perspective is particularly true with the case of To Lich river, located in the heart of Viet Nam\u2019s capital, where numerous plastic bags and cardboard boxes are thrown into the river, causing water pollution and creating an unsightly and foul-smelling environment that significantly impacts on resident\u2019s health and urban skylines. \r\n\r\nThe growth of e-shopping also affects human employment in both favorable and unfavorable manners. On the one hand, this trend creates many new opportunities for the labor market. It is because of maintaining an online store, various roles such as customer data administration, consulting staff and delivery drivers, opening up more employment opportunities for workers. On the other hand, as online purchasing becomes increasingly prevalent, traditional brick-and-mortar stores have to face the risk of bankruptcy. The reason for this is consumers tend to buy essential items such as food on online groceries thanks to its convenience, rather than going to nearby stores as before, leading to declines in the revenue of these stores, particularly those owned by older people who may struggle with cutting-edge. Grab is a perfect example for this phenomenon, especially since they offer grocery delivery online, consumers can simply use their mobile phone at home to order various goods including food, medicine, clothing and wait for the delivery drivers to arrive. This significantly reduces the number of customers visiting traditional stores and markets for shopping.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, online shopping impacts the environment and the labour market in both positive and negative ways.'",

Thus, only the particular areas are good for cultivating them. Places like deserts, volcanoes, north polar, and so on are the locations that you can not grow anything. Therefore, the people there always feel hungry. Most of them are not healthy. They do not have enough food, and not to mention eat healthy. Besides, some nations are in battles, and food producers such as farmers, butchers, fishermen, and so forth are running away from their hometowns. They do not want to work anymore. Hence, food is very expensive there. In those parts of the world, they have to rely on importing food from their neighbors. If their neighbors are not friendly, they will face difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe remedy I can think of is to use modern technologies to help them grow vegetables and fruits. About meat, meat may be not that important, because nowadays there are so many vegetarians. They do not eat meat, but they are still good in their lives. They are with strong bodies, no sicks, good figures, etc. In my view, developed countries should have to donate their extra food to the poor. Because every year they waste a lot of them, and give them to garbage bins.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, you can not eat food in every country. Because they may have a war or the place they live in is not appropriate for certain plants living. However, I think we can contribute our food to them by donating.

Do you think this is a positive or negative development' \n 'Text': 'More and more people are concerned about their outer image these days, some of whom even choose to go to beauty clinics to alter how their faces or bodies look. There are multiple factors that might drive them to make such decisions, which I believe, could be detrimental. In this essay, I will focus on the reasons of this phenomenon before moving on to its effects on both sides.\r\n\r\nSuch beauty chasers might have two major reasons to make changes to their lookings. First off, they may lack confidence on their appearance. For example, it is quite common for some beauty-lovers to complain about their noses being too big or eyes being too small, although they are actually fine. This is due to the inconfidence, which may facilitate them to make changes to such parts. However, not all patients go for operations are becuase of this. Another possible reason is to simply have a normal life. This particularly means the soldiers who have lost a part in war. Such solders who have been wounded tremendously need such cosmetic methods to have a normal looking and life they deserved.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that such surgery may make people happy and confident, it is harmful for most of the time. To begin with, patients may suffer from post-surgery side effects. This is because of the unknown long-term effects of some new technologies, which could be irreversible and might take years before emerging. Secondly, those operations may empty their pockets and lower their living standards. This means that those returning clients who are addicted to such alternations on their faces may spend hundreds of thousands on fixing and maintaining endlessly, having little budget left for basic needs. Having said that, it is true that such surgery may bring a brighter future for patients such as blind people who would like new eyes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the growing number of plastic-surgery customers is not a straightforward issue. Perfectionalism and medical need might be the major reasons why people choose to have such operations. As far as I am concerned, it is more of a negative tendency than a possitive one.'",

There are split opinions among people because many opine that everyone should be given equal amount of salary. However, I agree with those who reckon that the leaders should be paid more as compared to other workforce.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, CEOs in every firm are more skilled as well as experienced persons. They know all the ups and downs of market. They have the duty of project management, which is a vast area in every company. Infact, they do the risk evaluation before launching a project in the market. They are more skilled in doing more complex tasks and can take the responsibility of running a firm. For example; many executives after being leaders, open their own businesses and run it successfully. Therefore, they really deserve high salaries because of their experience and skilled\u00a0administration. \r\n\r\nMoreover, helping juniors and managing large workforce is another responsibility that is carried out on the shoulders of directors. In addition, new employees who are working on a project, need to be trained on a certain pathway. Infact, sometimes they can not operate efficiently rather than getting a proper training determined by their leaders. Hence, every CEO, is responsible for training the future workforce of the firm. Therefare, they deserve to get more payment because they are not only working for the present upliftment of company but for future also.\r\n\r\nTo Conclude, although some people believe that other workers should be given same salary as managers but I believe that executives should be given more payments due to having more responsibility and complex tasks. However, every firm should have to increase the money of other employees according to their work\u00a0and\u00a0experience.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion?' \n 'Text': 'Some people say that having a deep look into the family history is important, whereas others argue that focusing on the present and the next generation is the top priority. Although having an idea about what happened in the family past is essential, I support the latter view that paying attention to the present and the future of families is more crutial.\r\n\r\nConducting a research about family ancesters is meaningful as this helps members of a family to form a sense of belonging which will greatly boost the unity of the entire household. It would be benefitial for family members to have a thorough investigation about what happened in the past, and gain a deep understanding about where they came from and what their ancesters have been thgouth. For instance, youngsters can learn the past stories by asking their grand parents what happened when they were young or browsing photo albums, so they can form a sense of belonging by doing these. However, a family history cannot continue without the younger generation, therefore, ceasing the present is more practical.\r\n\r\nPaying more attention to what happens now and the younger generation is more feasible, as those are more important than the past. Young blood is key of the continuity of the family and what happens now matters as it can shape the family future. For example, Parents invest in a significate amount of money into their children's education, hobbies and health care, as they believe that their offsprings are their top priorit and every cent they spent now will build up a brighter future prospect for their children. Therefore, focusing on now and future is more vital.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, eventhough having a deep look into the family past is necessary, I would still support that paying attention to what happens now and the coming future is wiser.'",

Others, however, believe that school is the place to learn this.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Beyond doubt, there are many discussions revolving around the issue of whether being good person lessons should be given to children by their parents or other people agree with these are taught by schools. From my perspective, I support both ideas. In the next paragraphs, I will delve into the main reasons in their detail.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, why parents should teach their children because they spend a lot of time with their children and take care of their children. It is apparent that parents are idols for most children. For this reason, many children want to resemble their mother or father even sometimes it happens unconsciously. Consequently, good traits which are taught by parents can be very effective. If people take all this into account, parents should try to be careful around their children, and introduce good behaviour. I believe that families have an important influence on their children\u2019s behaviour, therefore, they ought to teach their children to be good person.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, school is also an important place which gives significant pieces of knowledge related to good behaviours. Many children listen to their teacher\u2019s advice because they believe their teacher is always right. Furthermore, teachers pass excellent courses about children psychology which they understand the way to teach these. Indirectly, good behaviours can be given productive by teachers because of scientific methods.  In my opinion, schools should support some pieces of knowledge about good behaviours because they have a good methodology about this.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I support the idea that good traits should be taught by eighter schools or families because children spend the half time with their parents and other teachers. Both have equal importance on the children learning of good traits. Neglecting one does not mean another one is enough. That is why eighter parents or schools should provide good traits learning, and tightly support each other.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\r\n\r\nOpinions differ regarding whether watching sports is a beneficial method of acquiring teamwork and strategy. Some argue that learning these skills is unattainable unless playing sports. This essay contends that both of these activities have vital roles to play to learn these skills.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some detailed techniques in professional sports can be learnt by analyzing the games using screen equipment off the court. Football games are the prime example of this method in which coaches explain some teamworking and strategies using extensive TVs. Consequently, developing coordinative and collaborative skills, the team can confront with the real football game properly and win the game. It would be inconceivable for a athlete to collaborate with their teammates on the court, specially in team-playing sports either basketball or football, without watching and assessing their team strategies before.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, teamworking plans and coordination need to test in real condition to ensure their efficiency. Techniques cannot be learnable solely through watching as they should be practiced and repeated to reach their practical level. If sports players just have some plans written on the paper, they are more likely not make this imagination into reality with any sense of factual experience. There are factors that can change the predefined strategies in reality such as fitness. If a member of a team lacks strong muscles, then they may struggle to implement strategies set before well. This necessitate playing the game to find such disruptive parameters which interfere with efficient teamwork.\r\n\r\nOn conclusion, there is an inevitable link between playing and watching sports games to learn them deeply and comprehensively. While watching and analyzing the games assists athletes in terms of planning teamwork and strategies, playing games are crucial to make these competencies practical.'",

Remote works will help workers to complete their works without being present in office as well as giving enough times to their families.

Doing such things allows them to purchase food from other states. What is more, when they are rich and do not need struggle for living, they will have time to learn the advanced techniques. For example, China used to lack food, but when we earned considerable money, we soon developed our skill about agriculture and now we do well in cultivating.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the reason for hunger may be the poor regions do not have skills which are good enough to feed themselves and the method can be enabling them to found a good economy and be rich.'",

In some situations their decisions depend on that whether they want to take risks or not. While there are some drawbacks of taking risks, I still believe that these cannot overshadow the benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, taking risks can bring out some obvious disadvantages. It is undeniable that taking risks might lead to big consequences that can have a serious impact on the person\u2019s life. For instance, last time I took a risk and decided to open my own coffee shop, it turned out to be not as simple as I thought it would be. I failed and lost a lot of money due to lack of knowledge in finance and business management. It also affected a lot my psychological state, I was burned out and depressed. Also, \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am concerned that the merits of taking risks outweigh the demerits. Firstly, decisions to risk might lead to success. For example, if a person, working as a simple consultant at some shop, decides to pull himself or herself together and talk with a director about a promotion at work, a person\u2019s request can be approved and he or she will move forward on the career ladder. Secondly, taking risks is usually about getting new experience and knowledge. Moreover, risk taking broadens person\u2019s horizons and helps person to look at the same situation from different sides.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are some pros and cons of taking risks, advantages definitely outweigh disadvantages. Not only does it help to move on the career ladder, but also risk taking provides an opportunity to get new experience.'",

What do you think about this type of requirement? Give details to support your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Attachment is what other schools require for students to graduate which will be voluntary work as one will not be paid. In my opinion this requirement is a necessary evil as it equips students for the future. More details will be alluded below.\r\n\r\nVolunteer work is very important to students for them to complete their studies as they will be helped attain the skill. Volunteer work means a student will be trained while working but not being paid and the truth is what one is taught in school theoretically needs to be practised before it is offered for payment in the world. A proffession such as nursing is a hands on kind of job so only theoretical training will not really suffice in the actual job hence the need to acquire voluntary training.\r\n\r\nMoreso, mandatory voluntary work is essential to the growth of  a nation. Young adults who are still studying have very innovative ideas that can make a country grow in every aspect. Econet a telecommunications company in Zimbabwe got its idea of Ecocash from a student who was still on training which now is one of its biggest cash cows of all time in all telecommunication companies in Zimbabwe. In return of that innovative idea, that student was then employed by that company so it is a win win situation.\r\n\r\nHowever, voluntary work has to be completely voluntary not for it to be attached to the one thing that students want which is to graduate. It being attached as a condition to graduate beats the purpose of it being voluntary.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, volunteer work before graduation is most fundamental in the development of a country and also on the skill that a student has acquired theoretically.'",

This writer believes that it is positive in this digital era due to the demand of consumers and a high standard lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that mass production with high character is necessary because of the large income of  population and serious competition between businesses. Therefore robots and artificial intelligence are very useful tools to upgrade and increase the amount of products because that technology can work with\r\n\r\nout any mistakes and fees while human workers need to be paid salaries. Controlling robots is also easier than a large team of people, managers just make programs for those computers or recruit several digital professionals for that field. Consequently, machines with smart minds and work effectively are replacing humans to improve quality of life.\r\n\r\nAnother argument worth considering the benefits of artificial intelligence can bring to consumers and society. Due to high requirements for health, beauty and quality of all kinds of products, robots are able to satisfy community with the perfect properties. Additionally, customers are also happier and feel that their spending is deserved and companies can sell more leading to stronger finance in a region or a country. As a result, the appearance of robots and artificial intelligence is significant to improve the life quality of citizens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  developed countries have the idea that updating the features of robots will turn into the main reason for unemployment.

Do you think this will have a positive and negative impact on society?' \n 'Text': 'The development in AI and robots fields are altering almost work of humans in most  big companies. It is the writer of this essay who contends that this is an adverse influence in the near future due to the significant changes in the amount of jobless people in all fields.\r\n\r\nOne of the core reasons  why humans are highly replaced by  robots and artificial intelligence is that they demand a massive amount of production from the industry. In  light of this, the productivity of robots and AI is always much for than that of humans. Moreover,  modern machines occupy the process of goods anytime under  control and without their breaking down. Take a recent article by a number of German workplaces as an example where people made workplaces without humans in all fields, they chose to replace with the developed AI tool to production to produce more and more efficient products. They also believed that the robots could complete an abundance of demands from the customers in their country if the demand  accounted for a massive amount.\r\n\r\nAnother argument  is that it is a negative development when AI and robots work all day instead of human activity. It can be seen that the percentage of unemployment around the world is higher when the robots and artificial intelligence fields are more developed. It is so challenging and difficult for people to apply for modern companies because of their weaker than the machines. Furthermore, most individuals strongly believe that the risk of the industry is less happen when  robots do in lieu of  humans. According to the latest news in America, there are a plethora of jobless people who do not have enough money for their life such as renting the house, demanding food and drinking, . . . because their company is improved by a large number of robots and automatic machines to produce and join in the process of their workplace anytime. They also hope to find a job notwithstanding their low pay. By the reason they think the AI engine system is a pressing issue  around the world when there is an increasing trend of unemployment.\r\n\r\nTaking all points into account, there are some negative elements that are beneficial as the development of robots and artificial intelligence may be altered completely and have a significant impact on the ability to work in the industry of humans in the near future.'",

Whereas others agree that this is not the only reason. I will discuss both views in this essay and I strongly agree with the latter idea because it is also needed for higher education and some businesses.\r\n\r\nThe first group claimed that learning a foreign language is just needed for a journey or work. This can be easily used when you know another language. For instance, while traveling abroad, if you do not know about the country`s language or an international speech, you will not be able to communicate with people or even you can not find the way back home. Besides, if you work for a foreign company you need to be knowledgeable in a foreign language in order to connect with your colleagues and customers.\r\n\r\nThe second notion about this issue is that it is more beneficial for learners and its advantages are more than the two mentioned. firstly, it is undeniable that when you know another language it is good for traveling and working. secondly the more of its advantages can be contraversial. For instance, if a person wants to higher education in a develped country such as England, Germany, or france, it is crucial for them to learn that country's tongue. thirdly, when it comes to businesses such as exporting products the knowledge of other languages is needed in order to communicate with people.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Although traveling and working could be one of the reasons why people tend to learn another language, I strongly believe that it has more advantages such as highering a degree and some business matters.'",

Additionally, I argue that it will help ensuring the safety for people in risk jobs, but it also the major reason for the rising of unemployment.\r\n\r\n     It must be acknowledged that robots and artificial intelligent work more effective than humans. To explain, while humans can only working from 8 to 10 hours per day, robots and AI working constantly for several days to meet th large requirement of products. For example, the Shoppee's shipping procedure is all make by automated machines instead of workers like before.\r\n\r\n     The lack of employees in some dangerous work is also raise considerable. In order words, young generation now does not willing to work in dangerous conditions, they usually have trend to does office work which have stable salary. It leads to a shortage of workers in risk jobs, so they have to ultilize robots to do those jobs. For instance, currrently, their is a repaired-robot used to fix undersea cables which rare people want to do due to it high water pressure.\r\n\r\n     Furthermore, the replacing of robots in dangerous jobs can ensuring the safety for people who do risks jobs. This is because, their still severals things which only can do by people so to keep safe , robots and artificial intellingent is used to support humans in dangerous situations. Take the job of digging underground tunnels as an example, people can using robots to investigate the conditions of soil and oxygen before digging to ensure safety for workers.\r\n\r\n     However, the enhancing of robots and AI in workplace also the major reason of the high-unemployed nowadays.

Some people look upon this phenomenon as a negative influence on young children, and I hold an identical opinion toward this statement, which will be thoroughly elaborated on as follows.  \r\n\r\nCelebrities are known for their luxurious lifestyle, which could negatively impact children. That is, Children are vulnerable to the influence of celebrities sharing on TV and social media, and it will let children mimic and be distracted by this superficial news. Take myself for example, I was addicted to a Korean youtuber\u2019s channel when I was in middle school. The YouTuber shared lots of luxury bags and brand cosmetics on her channel. To get the same items the Youtuber shared on social media, I took more part-time jobs to purchase a luxury bag, which I barely use daily. During that period, my school grades were declining. Besides, I started to get sick quickly because my body could not afford these works. \r\n\r\nContinuing to share glamorous lives will spread misconceptions that purchasing a luxury lifestyle is the life goal. To be more specific, the priority for young children should be to explore their talents and learn new knowledge rather than spending time on pursuing fancy clothes or competing fancy shose and backpack at school. For example, when teenagers are addicted to these superficial items, they will not care about what is happening in the world and do not care about what new technology is created. After few years, the country will lose talented workforc, and it has a horrible impact to the country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, based on the aforementioned, celebrities who known for the wealth instead of their contribution indeed have negative effects to youth due to spreading misconceptions and concept to young children.'",

It would be more beneficial to spend this \r\n\r\nmoney to build new houses and roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.' \n 'Text': 'It is believed that the government should allocate their spending for building new facilities in key urban centers rather than repairing old buildings. I will show my support for this idea in this essay.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of this viewpoint often exaggerate the advantages that repairing and restoring old buildings offer. This is because demolition and dismantling of old buildings can create a lot of dust and constructive waste released into the environment, causing increasingly worsened environmental pollution in urban centers, especially the air pollution. However, this perspective fails to consider the huge cost of repair and restoration of old buildings which are not a one-time cost, as these activities require constant maintenance costs including structures, designs, and visuals. This is particularly true in the case of a lot of old apartments in Vietnam which need maintenance annually to ensure residents\u2019 safety and these apartments\u2019 visuals, leading to the waste of money but effective not high. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the government\u2019s investing in new facilities can offer long-term benefits, as new facilities require less maintenance cost and operating cost with longer life expectancy, offering long-term cost saving for the government and individuals. Moreover, investing in new buildings and new facilities can advance city infrastructure, because this allows for the integration of modern infrastructure including saving-energy systems, smart technologies, and sustainable design methods. This not only improves features and quality of facilities but also contributes to the development of a more resilient and advanced urban infrastructure system. A perfect example for this is Vinhome Ocean Park, a smart urban area in Vietnam, which is designed at modern building standards including energy-saving systems, environment-friendly technologies, creating a safe and sustainable habitat for residents as well as contributing to a modern and flexible urban infrastructure system. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although repairing and restoring old buildings can benefit the environment, I purposefully advocate that the government should invest in constructing new facilities due to the long-term cost savings and the development of city infrastructure.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is universally admitted that the ever-alarming rate of traffic accidents is one of the thorniest issues concerning governments the world over. Amongst the arguments surrounding how to improve traffic safety, one school of thought claims that this aim could solely be realized by disciplining traffic offenders stricter. While this course of action works to a certain extent, I would not believe that it is the only solution to such a problem, and am going to suggest other measures that are no less viable.\r\n\r\nIt is understandable why some advocate tightening the punitive sanctions upon traffic violators. The key rationale behind this notion is that doing so would deter traffic participants from breaking road regulations. Deterrent measures, such as levying a hefty fine on traffic light runners or indefinitely confiscating driver's licences of those who drive under the influence, would go a long way in ensuring the culture of safe driving among the masses, contributing to lower rates of traffic-related fatalities and injuries. Therefore, it seems sensible why punishing traffic offenses more aggressively is one of the valid proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that issuing heavier punishments is the sole solution to the problem of road safety seems rather short-sighted, since there could be other remedies as follows. First, fixing road defects such as potholes, poor-conditioned signage and uneven surface would be effectual in curbing the incidence of traffic accidents occasioned by said road imperfections. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the public's awareness of traffic security should be raised. Since most vehicle crashes arguably stem from poor driving behaviors, educating the populace of how driving safely could spare not only their lives but also others' would directly confront one of the root causes of traffic accidents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while imposing stricter penalties on traffic law-breakers is indeed one of the approaches that may yield desirable results, I am against the idea that only by adopting this solution could traffic safety improve, since there could still be other effective measures as mentioned above.'",

They are do not want to go out and they can sit and watch everything all over the ward. Therefore they addict it. There are have variety of entertainment. Such as movies, and video games, all over the ward news and advertisement. Therefore, nowadays, children and adults get addicted to it and they don't want to get good side it. For example, some students after schools watch TV like the cartoon Tom and Jerry they don't want to do anything about another thing.\r\n\r\nThe other major case is those who start to watch television may not close it. They spend a lot of time with them. it has killed people many times and they do not have time even with families. Therefore, it is family bonding and love is lost. For instance, some family's parents more and more addicted to watching international movies. Even they bring food for out and give it to children so they watch movies. As a result, it is killed family bonds.in this way, people can have more entertainment too.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they can use it for education it can be more beneficial.

How can this problem solved? provide specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Today city people use various types of transportation to go to work, grocery shopping, bringing their children to school or college, travel, etc. They used either public transportation or private cars. Although the number of people use public transportation for their commutes has increased, the roads still face lots of vehicles.\r\n\r\nFirst, the reason why the streets are still crowded is the fixed structure and number of streets that can accommodate a fixed number of vehicles, while at the same time increasing the number of private vehicles due to the increasing of city population. Therefore, despite more usage of public transportation, people still suffering from traffic jams. So, the first act I suggest is a government rule to limit the number of vehicles each family holds. Research by Summit University shows that in London, the city suffers from traffic congestion, each family have approximately 1.8 vehicles. So, the government must limit this rate to one by law.\r\n\r\nSecond, people are comfortable using their own car for their commute. Lack of the number of bus or tramp stations, large distance from the origin to the station and long waiting time are the main reasons that someone prefers to use his private car. Also, most workers are live in suburbs and public transportation in suburbs is not developed properly. I suggest increasing the number of bus stations outside downtown and in suburbs, strengthening the fleets and offering discounts for those are going to or return from school or college specially in the morning traffic peak.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government rules or development of public transportation may decrease private cars on urban roads, but the traffic problems are solved with urban culture. Despite setting laws to force the people to not use private cars, culture could make using buses and tramps their first choice.'",

Children's are pliable and it is upto us to give them right direction and suitable environment to grow up . One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is a colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that family play a vital role in children's devlopment while a good number of people who says other sources like tv ,friends , school , newspaper have better influence on child's growth . There is a range of conflicting arguments releted to the assertion . In upcoming paragraphs I'll not only shed light on the matter but also elaborate on my point of view.\r\n\r\nTo embark on , if we have a deep look at the assertion we will certainly be able to identify myriad reasons why communities believe family has the greatest impact on children's growth . The first and foremost reason is , family is the first school of a child . From the beginning offsprings spend most of the time with their parents therefore they get the primary lessons from their family . Furthermore , children's are good observer . As a result , children observe their parents and adapt their nature and behaviour that's the reason why people believe family play crucial role in child's development . More over , spending time with family not only strengthen their bond but also it help them toh know their roots deeply . \r\n\r\nOn the paradoxical side , a good number of people believe that besides family other sources like television or friends have greater influence on child's development . The foremost reason is , television Play a part and parcel role in our lives . Television provides huge range of channels from all over the world which helps them to know about the other cultures and traditions and also lhelp them to leany languages . To elaborate, nowadays children watches cartoons in English which helps them to learn language at very young age . Take example my brother , his first language is Bangla but he used to watch cartoons in English when he was young and from very young age he learnt to speak in English because of the cartoon shows he used to watch. It's really helped him in his academic years . Furthermore , spending time with peees can devlope communications skills, team work , leadership and many more . They get to meet new people at every stage and learn from them which helps them to grow in a successful person . \r\n\r\nTo sum up, family and others sources like tv , peers both have their importance . Family plays a crucial role in the initial stages of a child's development, providing emotional support, moral guidance, and shaping early learning experiences.External factors like television and friends begin to exert a greater influence as children grow older, expanding their social circles beyond the family. As far as I can see it can be said that external factors ha the greatest influence on children's devlopment.'",

According to a BBC news article, painting helps to lower the level of stress significantly and doing it on a regular basis develops fresh neural connections, which eventually makes a positive outcome on the health condition. Another riveting fact that was observed among a large group of dancers, they are more likely to stay in shape rather than those who do not dance. Thus, it provides not only mental relaxation but also socializing within others from the dance class, better muscle rate in body and, finally, confidence. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some people might argue aforementioned statement and find downsides. Personally, I believe the most negative outcome of crafting is excessive producing of hobby appliances. The planet is endangered in terms of garbage pollution and greenhouse gases. It is vital to recycle used materials in order to combat climate change and global warming. Moreover, some artists could go through a quite challenging process of mastering their hobby into a real job. It might be frustrating and energy consuming, however, if a person puts enough effort, they will definitely succeed. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, artwork has plenty of profits because it improves health condition, raises confidence and helps with inner distress, while others believe that craftwork affects the environment badly and involves new coming entrepreneurs into a tough business, which causes various challenges on their way.'",

While this has admittedly certain benefits, I would argue that this is a fairly negative trend because its demerits are far more pronounced. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why people with health issues are trying alternative medicines without advice from doctor. Perhaps the foremost benefit of this choice is that it may quickly help the patients to deal with some normal diseases. For example, there are a couple of slight symptoms, such as: nose congestion, cough or fever under 38 degrees Celsius, which could be treated by some kind of medicines bought in pharmacy stores. In fact, many individuals have been successful with this treatment method, so they keep doing it in the next time when they get sickness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that the aforementioned advantages pale in significance when compared to the drawbacks of using medicines without agreement of doctor. The prominent disadvantage is that if people predict wrong disease based on their symptoms, this will be extremely harmful to their health condition. For instance, the first expression of Covid-19 pandemic is running nose or headache being quite similar to that of flu. Therefore, in this case, the patient eating medicines at home without medical check-up could make their illness more serious.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, trying medicines without direction of doctor when having sickness is quite negative, because its benefits are significantly overshadowed by the drawbacks.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Many organizations and companies ask their staff to wear a uniform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary working environment, there is an increasing of requiring about wearing uniform for employees. From my perspective, the regulation about a working uniform has both benefits and drawbacks in many aspects. I will explore two sides in the following essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, wearing a uniform at the workplace plays a vital role in promoting staff's performance and buidling the company' image and credibility. Firstly, workers will have positive experiences when they wear the same gear. It is clear that a sense of inferiority about their background can be eliminated through the uniform. As a result, they gain more energy to boost their productive and enhance their company's operation. One more reason is that the company will establish the profession image via using uniform for workers. It is evident that this regulation is a great way to identify their brand as well as maintain hygience. Consequently, they attain more reputation as a top-notch firm which helps their image are pupolar in businiess market. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I argue that forcing to wear uniform at organizations or firms will have detrimental influences on staff's morale. Initially, not everyone find the standard sizes and cosy metarials of their uniform. Obviously, they may have feelings of uncomfortable and annoyed when putting this clothes on their body. For example, wearing a shirt uniform which is does not fit can create unrelaxing for most activities, contributing to decrease their abilities in solving tasks. Furthermore, the majority of employees contend that the uniform cramp their exressions compared with their regular clothes. This will lead to the significant affects in communicating with customers or their colleages. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, wearing the uniform in working has always remained a controversial topic in policy of organizations. From my angle, I believe that the uniform will create a positive team vibe, promoting efficiency work for the staffs.'",

Do you agree or\r\n\r\ndisagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is a saying that technology should take over the place of teachers. I firmly disagree with this idea because the cost will be expensive and it loses the touch of humans and also cannot meet the individual needs of learners.\r\n\r\nReplacing teachers completely in the classroom with technologies is not feasible for school management as it costs a significant amount of money. Schools  usually have limited funding, and replacing all educators with advanced technologies requires new equipment such as tablets with interactive touch screens, electronic white boards and cameras which enable school operators to monitor students. In this case, operating a high-tech classroom would be more expensive than having teachers on site. Therefore, it would be impossible to replace educators.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, taking over personnel with technology may lead to the individual needs of students being unmet. It is because the learning skills and capabilities of every single student are different, without proper guidance and supervision from experienced teachers, it would be difficult to design tailored study plans to meet individuals' needs. Hence, having all teachers  replaced by technologies may oversee learners who have special study needs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that teachers should be fully replaced by modern technologies because they normally cost over budget and do not meet the study needs of students with special conditions.'",

Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'While some people hold that accepting a bad condition is a good choice, others are of the opinion that people should make improvement on such circumstance. This essay will closely examine both views before concluding that I agree with the latter. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why some people propose that it is best to accept a bad situation. The key rationale is that this helps humans to release their pressure even when the problem still exists without any actions to solve it. This is because there are some challenges being impossible to overcome, so staying in harmony with such difficulties is like a placebo making our spirit balanced. For instance, when a person is lacking of money, he may allocate his budget to meet the basic demand as foods or accommodation, and could not pay for luxury clothes or party with friends. This is a temporary solution to deal with such situation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I side with those who say that each person should try their best to enhance difficult situations. Perhaps, the foremost reason would be that this is the best method to resolve the root of problem. In fact, the difficulties in life make people exhausted and have bad influence on both physical and mental health. Therefore, everyone should improve such issues to not only live a happier and healthier life but also contribute to a positive society. For example, if a person has an unsatisfactory job, he should attempt to gain more knowledge, master the skills to prepare for a better position in the future which benefits him in long-term.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are justifications for advocating for the acceptability of negative situations, I would contend that everybody should give efforts to enhance such cases.'",

Both perspectives regarding this notion are discussed with few pertinent examples further in this essay.\r\n\r\nIn order to those people who think that governments should raise helping hands to provide financial support to the entertainer personalities of our nation. To be more precise, artists, instrumental players and philosophers are the prominent entertainers in our lives. They are significant resources to rejuvenate our minds and body after tiring work schedules. For Example, artists plays vital role in media industry to showcase dramas and movies as a fascinating way of entertainment for people. Similarly, musicians sing songs, help us to unwind stress and refresh us in our daily lives. So that, to escalate and maintain these evoking activities government should facilitate them both financially and morally. Morover, poetry is pivotal for the identification and civilization of a country, it is necessary for the governments to conduct event which emphasises on mother language in a nation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those few who do not agree with this notion are not on right. It would not be a waste of money if particular budget is impromptu. It will be wrong if exceed amount is spend only on these entertainments by forgetting other mendatory aspects of a country such as health, education and employment etc. For example, people who germane to under privileged families for them governments spending on other activities prior to their basic needs to mitigate their poverty is wasted. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is imparitive for the governments to support artists, musicians and poets finicially to gain multifarious benefits to these entertainments, to maintain cultural assets, diminish nation people's stress and widespread mother tongue though the poetry plays around the world. In my assertion it should be government's obligation to maintain and facilitate them financially and morally.'",

It seems that , in a number of nations today way of living for offspring is very different from who lived in the past. I think this alteration has its own pros and cons, I will discuss both sides and support it with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the previous generation that lived in the same locations as today  experienced different aspects of existence and their needs and knowledge were suited to that time. For example, they mostly played outside of houses and had a large figure of friends so their social skills and their bodies were better. These beneficial points were  that in that erea was usual for children to spend their time  playing with bulky groups of friends and experiencing significant physical activities, along with these plays they gained stamina and made the number of people  communicate more with them. For clarification, noises that were made by youth in streets and parks have been eliminated during these years and physical games and large groups of teens have vanished simultaneously, also charts that were released by researchers indicated that obesity among this generation has increased dramatically.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, along positive aspects of the last generation, there was a sum  of drawbacks that halted those teens struggling with that, such as no equal access to all functions same  schools and essential factors. Since the world  started to upgrade many evidence have changed such as the number of schools and also rules that give rights to offspring to maintain their basic needs. For instance, between 1910 to 1950 figure of Americans had no access to public schools and they had to travel remote distances to be able  to study. Additionally , nowadays children have the right to follow their real wants and talents because of the variety of fields however in past there were few choices and they had to just pick between those.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Life has changed for the younger age group and it's not comparable to past generations. In past they often palyed out side and spend major amount of their time with their tribe , although, they had not access to sufficient options and chance of education.'",

On the contrary, the others think that it is essential to have the right of making decision in childhood because its affects. In my opinion, a child needs a freedom in the way of living and sharing its tastes like other human being in everyday matters.\r\n\r\nChildren who can make a decision about their needs are more confident. Although parents have to lead and guide them to make a reasonable choice, they should teach youth the importance of having confidence and telling their own ideas instead of being quiet and obedience. If we do not give this opportunity to a child to say her/his opinion, it would makes him/her a potential victim of bullying in near future. For instance, pupils who are more free to say their thoughts about what they want experience less bullying than those who are shy and raised by method of obeying from parents in order to what they wear or eat. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for this mindset is achieving more democratic and equal society by teaching children to have their own choices in every day matters. Young generation are the next citizens who can defense their right in future if they see how they can do it from the early beginning. When they are allowed to be treated as a person respectfully in their preferences and what they want, it can not only improve their sense of identity but also eradicates any possibility of being a deactivate individual. We are witness the impact of these little activities in recent changes in political aspects and societies which is done by recent generations for example [in Iran]. Through this, world may be obviously healthier and better place for human kinds to live freely with less oppression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having right of choice in childhood about what they want as hobby, clothes or food is a vital part of nurturing. This is a real protection to defense themselves form bullying in school also as a civilized person against any dictatorial behavior or policy.'",

This essay will exert considerable circumstances which pave the way for creating crime and proposes preventive solutions to address this prominent issue.\r\n\r\nOne of the pivotal reason comes up with socioeconomic factor is characterized by poverty. Individuals undergo using of illegal act to survive as poverty deprives them from basic necessities such as food, home and healthcare. For those facing inadequate economic condition which surrounding lack of enough money, resorting to use criminal act such as burglary, drug trafficking, may seem the viable choice to get rid of this problem.

Hence, In this essay, I will delve into both statements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, water is might be considered as a mother of nature. To clarify, it is widly accepted that flora and fuana need water to stay alive. For instance, many first villages and fram lands located near rivers, lakes, and the sea in the past. Furthermore, most farmers need water to plant and grow their products, necessary to use as human's food.

However, there is also a persuasive argument that teenagers should work straight when finishing school.This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favor of the former notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why getting employed after high school could be attractive. Firstly, Teenagers making this decision could become more independent. As a result, by earning their own income,they could be able to establish a stable life, start a family, or travel, and this could also help them become more mature. Also, by working early, youngsters would have more chances to gain real experience. This is because they could have more time to hone practical skills, such as time management or problem-solving abilit. and This may lead to promotions and a successful career.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that youngsters should choose to pursue higher education. One reason is that this choice helps the young to open their social network. By engaging in club activities and projects in university, they could make new friends and connect with professors, which would make them have a variety of high-paid job choices. Another reason is that applicants could chase dream work having academic qualifications by the required profession. For instance, in Vietnam, being a doctor requires a bachelor's medical degree, so that university graduates with this major are more likely to successfully apply in this position..\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, due to the reasons stated above, I believe that students are more likely to enjoy a successful career in the long run if they possess a college or university degree.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that working early could have some benefits, I would contend that enrolling in higher education is better.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion' \n 'Text': 'There are opposite views whether house should be build based on certain rules or ones preferences. This essay will discuss both views alongside with my own opinion on each notion. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, similar design in order to match the tradition that has been carried locally. It can be seen through several traditional hamlets in Scotland, where people do not have liberty to build and design their accommodation based on modern trends. The maximum innovation that can be placed on each house is only the opt to put small chimney on the roof, which can differentiate each house. Based on the interview retrieved from The Guardian with one of the locals, they said that distinctive exterior designs as well as the building structures can potentially ruin and threat the images of the village that have been carried and nourished since late 1900s, which want to be introduced to visitors; therefore local municipalities decide to issued local decree for villagers who want to reside in that area. Even though that condition can be a good opportunity to respect and introduce local traditions to outsiders, I believe that condition can hinder people\u2019s creativity. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the allowance to design house based on personal preferences enables people to fulfill their own requirements. Generally, there are some family members that require particular innovations that should be taken into consideration when they want to build a house. Imagine if someone cannot install a designated chair elevator for the mobility of the senior members in their family due to particular restrictions. Consequently, it can deteriorate their physical functions and lower their immune system, since their movements are limited. Therefore, I agree with this notion because house can be seen as one of the prominent investments for people to heighten their health conditions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although designing house based on particular styles can be a good opportunity to match the local tradition, I believe that people should have their own liberty to build their dream house, as it can be adjusted to fulfill their personal requirements.'",

The health of citizens is in their own hands and they should, therefore, be held accountable for that. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'The growing belief on the accessible of healthcare systems has raised concerns, especially for those who assume that each person should be able to count on themselves regarding health conditions, which eventually embarks an opinion that people should be charges if using the systems. I remarkably disgaree with that notion, and this essay will discuss my reasons behind that position.\r\n\r\nNot every people has privilege to have access in decent health services. Take, for example, the older people who live in rural areas where they are isolated from proper healthcare facilities and equipment. Obviously, they will need high coverages to receive those treatments. Reflecting the conditions that they may not have any saving since they are unemployed, the responsibility to pay for the costs will be unbearable, which later can cause financial difficulties, resulting in higher rate of debts. Thus, it can be argued that it will negatively impact their economy in the long run. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the policy to charge solely on citizens is injustificable. Even though it is true that each person should be responsible for their own health conditions, it is not the only factor that contributes to the necessity for accessing the healthcare services. External factors such as air pollution, virus and natural disasters are likely contribute to the healthiness level of citizens, which can be derived from the failure of programmes that should be established by municipalities in order to alleviate the risks of the given phenomena. Hence, it can be said that local authorities should also take part to fund the provision of healthcare systems to its citizens.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I completely disagree with the sentiment that the costs for retrieving healthcare services should be solely be accounted to public since it is their responsibility. Although that statement true, the fact health conditions are also influenced by external factors, and not every people have an equal privilege to access the health services support my view to the given statement.'",

It is self-evident that air travel is the fastesty option comparing with other domestic means of transports.

However some assert that these activities do not effect their intelligence. I believe that the brain of youngesters can be flourished by these hobbies owing to a number of compelling reasons.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most rational justification is that electronic game equipments and TV can be instructive. That is, the young ones who are encounter with TV programs and video games ferequently, learn new skills unconsciously. A good illustration of this is, learning second language through out cartoons and games which are provided in other country. This phenomenon leads to children learning while they are entertained. Furthermore, this behaviour may reduce stress and axiety among youngesters. In this modern world children are effected by mental deseases like adults and watching an exciting television show or a stimulating video game can realse their stress and make them feel more relax and relief.\r\n\r\nYet, another compelling argument is that youngesters who use electronical gadgets to spend their time are more likely to respond toward the real life problems. To put it differently, most of these hobbies are included hard tasks to do and usually are mentally demanding, therefore; strengthen the youngs' mind. For instance their self-confidence increaces after achieving the final stage of a competitive computer game so they feel, they are good enough to take responsibility of almost every issue in their life.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, considering the points discussed above, the most rational conclusion to be drawn is that, new entertainment equipments causes youngesters to be ammused and also flourish.

It is my contention that parents are responsible for educating their children on how to become good members of society. However, this essay will discuss the influence improper behaved learners have on schools, even though schools should also encourage good manners. \r\n\r\nOne paramount concern for teachers is the lack of good behaviour among learners. For example, High School Settlers recently reported that 25% of their school learners are involved in gang related crime, which resulted in the stabbing of an innocent learner. Given this, many schools are struggling to control proper discipline in classrooms because of a few bad behaved learners. Thus, I believe that adequate manners should be taught at home, so that it does not affect other learners at school. \r\n\r\nDespite this, schools have the responsibility to rehabilitate troubled students. For instance, The Department of Education introduced a new regime where schools should accommodate learners based on all their needs, and place them in a rehabilitating program if necessary. Hence, schools have a moral obligation to transform a learner for the better of society. However, even though it is compulsory for schools to always improve a learner\u2019s behaviour, parents ought to instil this at home. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there has been much debate on whether parents or schools are responsible for the behaviour of a child. In my opinion, the fundamental roots of good manners should be encouraged at home, where a student can rather inspire proper behaviour at school. Schools cannot be held responsible if bad behaviour is tolerated at home.'",

Even more so, some countries are obligated to allow all ages to apply for open vacancies. In my opinion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing all ages to apply, the overall impact leans toward the negative. \r\n\r\nOne paramount concern is that some occupations undoubtedly require a certain amount of years experience to fully comprehend the job requirements. For example, Marine Exploration in Iraq requires all applicants to be at least 35 years old, as the job is mentally draining. Moreover, occupations like pilots, surgeons or sergeants often require excessive life experience and failure to this could lead to depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Given this, it is evident that there are certain occupations who require an individual to obtain a sufficient amount of life experience, and legalizing all ages to apply might have a negative outcome. \r\n\r\nDespite this, one notable benefit is the unparallel convenience that it offers pensioners. For instance, Global Engineering has no retirement age as they believe some minds do not age and can still be beneficial to the company. However, the likelihood that an underaged child or pensioner can perform at the same performance level as a seasoned specialist in its prime is scarce. Thus, it is my contention that job vacancies should rather have an age restriction. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allowing all ages to apply for a job can be beneficial for individuals who can do the tasks no matter their age. However, there are too many occupations that must have an age restriction due to mental maturity. If people of all ages are allowed to apply for jobs, then certain occupations might not be able to perform as they should.'",

I strongly disagree, since the absence of a diverse range of veggies and fruits will have detrimental effects on several regions. Conversely, some individuals within the community may possess a surplus of resources. The following paragraphs will explain the drawbacks of the perspective and provide pertinent examples. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is important to note that many regions throughout the globe exhibit distinct climatic conditions that might potentially disrupt agricultural growth. Certain strategies thrive in warm weather, while others thrive in cold weather. For instance, a coconut need a humid and warm atmosphere in order to thrive and endure. Consequently, regions with low temperatures would lack access to these items if they are not delivered, along with several other food items. since a result, the population will experience negative consequences since the body need essential vitamins derived from vegetables and fruits. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, several crops provide a substantial quantity of items that need fast consumption. Otherwise, they will get obsolete and become obsolete. For example, it is necessary to consume fruits such as strawberries, bananas, and apples during a period of one week after their ripening stage. If the communities only consume local food, they would be unable to get it quickly and a significant portion of it would be squandered. Hence, it is essential to distribute the produce to other regions, not only to mitigate wastage but also to facilitate the commerce of the whole harvest. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I believe that food should not be only eaten by local residents, but rather supplied to other regions that need them in order to minimise waste and enhance enterprises' profitability. Furthermore, everybody around the globe would be granted universal access to all Vitamins.'",

What are the causes and solutions for this problem?' \n 'Text': 'Today, the distance between people who live at the highest level of  society and people who live at the lowest level of  society has  increased.This essay will argue that most politicians put their attention and assets on rich people beside of increasing the rate of inflation. Also, this essay will suggest that to overcome these situations, providing some positions for poor people to invest their money and increasing our concern about domestic products are the main solutions.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, these days most  people who have a position in government in a country only put their all effort into rich people. Furthermore, the inflation rate in the modern era is one of the crucial concerns for many countries. The vast majority of governments around the world need funding, so to reach this goal they give more attention and assets to rich people. Also,  a couple of years ago human beings  faced different catastrophic situations which had a negative effect on the world's economy as well as increased the inflation rate. For instance, the inflation rate between  2019 and 2020  rose to more than 20% because of Corona pandemic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to overcome this situation providing some opportunities for mid-level or low-level of society to invest part of their wages in governmental projects ,and reducing the dependency to other nations could be the main solutions. If politicians can change their perspective and provide a situation where poor people can invest a small amount of money in it to reach a lot of benefits instead of only using  rich people's assets, it could help other levelslevel of society to reduce their gap from rich people. Also, if governments just focus on domestic products instead of importing other materials that can be produced in the country, they can create more job opportunities for people especially poor people. As a result, not only the inflation rate would resist  different situations but also a lot of employees can find a good job with a great wage. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in the modern day the gap between two groups of people, rich and poor level, has  increased due to a lot of attention by governments to rich people and rising inflation globally. However,  providing a situation for the investment of poor people and decreasing the dependency on other nations are the main answers to this gap.'",

It has some pros and cons which I will discuss in the bullet points in the forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many reasons that people prefer to choose their self-work first, individuals work on their own they don't want to work under any other person. Second, the flexibility of time is available for self-employment a person can take leave on their wish and can go early home without any restriction. Third, people become more self-independent by earning more money and self-reliance. For example, A freelancer can earn a large amount of money by working on many projects and according to suitable working hours.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  self-employment has some disadvantages along with these advantages such as bankruptcy and social problems. To start a business an individual has to take a loan from the bank and after some time due to many reasons consequences occur the business is not going well so all the money goes to waste and the person bankrupt. Also, after opening an own business social problems occur such as isolation from the family due to workload and the person may go into depression due to not proper work. For example, A person takes a 50 lakh loan from the bank and starts a TV business unluckily the business is not going well all the money goes to waste and he goes into depression.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, nowadays, individuals choose to work for their own rather than for any Association. I agree with the statement because of the plateau of work, self-reliance, and self-independence. Nevertheless, some cons like loss of money and social issues.'",

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'In the perpetual pursuit of personal fulfillment and societal progress, the dichotomy between present mindfulness and future planning emerges as a perennial point of contention. While some advocate for the primacy of living in the moment, arguing that excessive preoccupation with the future detracts from the richness of present experiences, others champion the necessity of strategic foresight and goal-setting to navigate the complexities of life effectively. In this discourse, I contend that both perspectives hold intrinsic value, and a harmonious integration of present focus and future planning is essential for holistic well-being and sustainable success.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, proponents of present-centered living emphasize the profound significance of cherishing each moment and embracing the inherent beauty of the present. Indeed, life unfolds in the immediacy of now, and the cultivation of mindfulness enables individuals to savor the richness of sensory experiences, cultivate authentic connections with others, and foster a deep sense of gratitude and contentment. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that incessant fixation on future goals and aspirations detracts from the spontaneity and joy inherent in the present moment, leading to a life lived in perpetual anticipation rather than genuine engagement.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the practice of mindfulness has been empirically linked to numerous psychological and physiological benefits, including stress reduction, enhanced emotional resilience, and improved overall well-being. Research conducted by luminaries in the field of positive psychology, such as Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, underscores the transformative power of mindfulness practices in promoting mental clarity, emotional balance, and a profound sense of inner peace. Thus, proponents of present-focused living assert that the pursuit of fulfillment lies not in the ephemeral promises of the future but in the profound richness of the here and now.\r\n\r\nConversely, advocates of future planning argue that strategic foresight and goal-oriented behavior are indispensable for achieving long-term success and fulfillment. Indeed, the ability to envision future possibilities, set clear objectives, and chart a course of action is integral to personal and professional growth. By cultivating a proactive mindset and making deliberate choices aligned with their aspirations, individuals can navigate uncertainty with confidence and resilience, ultimately realizing their full potential.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, strategic planning enables individuals to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and cultivate a sense of direction and purpose in their lives. Whether in the realms of education, career advancement, or financial management, the benefits of prudent foresight and goal-setting are evident in facilitating progress and attainment of desired outcomes.

However, I firmly believe that in some ways it is not a good idea, and they should not be allowed to have lots of it. I totally disagree that and, I will elaborate on my point of view in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo start with, kids should be watched in their behaviors because they are so young and they do not know the thing is right or wrong. Under parents' surveillance, kids may not make serious mistakes. For example, fathers or mothers should have to stand in the playground with their kids. If kids get injured, they can deal with it instantly. That is very important. If children have plenty of free time, that will be risky. Who knows what will they do in that period?\r\n\r\nOn top of that, kids usually do not have too much homework to do in the early grades in elementary schools. As a result, they have enough leisure time to do anything they want. Some of them do not go to learn instruments, sports, languages, and so on. They feel so bored all the time. Therefore, some gangsters think this is good for recruit them to do illegal stuff. For instance, when I was a primary school student, some of my classmates joined a criminal organization. They did some things bad, and several guys were caught by polices. In the end, they were living in a jail.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, in order to keep your kids safe, it is vital to deprive some part of their freedom. Another reason is that if they have time they do not how to use it, they may be hired by someone and they could do terrible things. Thus, they should not have a long time for themself.'",

Do advantages outweigh disadvanatges?' \n 'Text': 'Today many people in some countries are facilitated to consume cheap goods by the government. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, both sides will be explored before evaluating whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nRegarding the benefits, perhaps, it might be said that cheaper goods can be more accessible to many people. This can improve people's quality of life with basic and luxury goods, thus enabling more comfortable and pleasant living conditions. In addition, the availability of cheap goods can stimulate economic activity by increasing consumer spending, which contributes to economic growth. For example, the middle class is helped economically to fulfill their needs.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should not ignore the various drawbacks that this phenomenon may bring about. First, over-reliance on cheap imported goods can lead to a country's dependence on foreign markets, posing risks to national security and economic autonomy. Second, low prices often lead to overconsumption, which can generate significant waste, contributing to environmental degradation. In this case, it is very detrimental to ecosystems and society. Finally, mass production of cheap goods is often associated with unethical labor practices, including exploitation and unsafe working conditions in some countries. For example, fast and cheap food brands often rely on cheap labor in developing countries, where workers, most of whom are women, are exposed to poor working conditions, long hours, low wages, and even forced labor in some cases. This exploitation perpetuates the cycle of poverty and inequality.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I am of the opinion that the lack of measurement of trends relating to cheap goods can be a substantial drawback. As such, it outweighs the potential benefits.'",

In this essay, I will discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages of this development. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, one advantage could be the time saved. Firstly, all the time we usually spend travelling and getting ready, is not required while working from home. Another advantage would be the convenience of working from bed and also the advantage of multi-tasking, for example, it will be possible to work and cook at the same time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I said above, working from home looks easier and comfortable, but is the same time could bring a lot of disadvantages in our lives. One of them could be social lack, no more meeting your colleagues, also just laying in  bed cold brings health issues such as obesity, or spine problems because of the comfortable position,  you are not travelling anymore, you do not get  fresh air in the morning you used to had while travelling and also the sunlight is very important, and again, you will not have that if you are not going out of your home and travel for work.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, working from home has advantages and disadvantages and the best option I believe is to find the balance between those, working from home some days, and  others travelling for work, avoiding the social lack and all the health issues.'",

I agree with the statement that children go to co-educational institutions because youths can gain various experiences and knowledge.\r\n\r\nAs education is an important integral part of preparing a future generation, parents and grandparents need to decide which type of schools (multi or single genders), they send their children to.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Some individuals believe that there should be some charges for  entrance to museums, while others argue that there should be free access to museums without any fees. Although having free access to museums can encourage more visitors, I believe that institutions which charge fees provide them with a necessary and steady source of income, enabling them to maintain and improve their collections and facilities.\r\n\r\nHaving free access to museums can encourage more visitors. This is due to the fact that people who are from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds and underprivileged societies can visit there and in any other case they are unable to afford high entry charges. When there are no ticket prices, it encourages a lot of individuals to visit exhibitions as compared with the time of admission fees.For example, a national museum in Britain shows the arrival rate is higher during the time when there is no ticket price while tendency among visitors to make excursions during paid time periods is decreased. However, I believe that free museums can struggle with funding for maintenance, acquisitions, and quality exhibitions.\r\n\r\nCharging fees by gallery provide them with a regular source of income which they can utilise towards furnishing of building and providing more facilities. This is because cultural and historical buildings require huge amounts of money to perform their functions without any obstructions. There are two sources of these funds one is donation and the other one is earnings. To manage these buildings successfully, alone donation did not serve the purpose, earnings from sources will be required as well and entry fees is the main source of earnings in the case of these institutions. For example, one research study shows that in order to run museums efficiently and effectively, they should have regular sources of money such as admission fees, on the contrary, donation is a non-recurring source. For this reason, I believe that buildings should charge entry fees which ensures their source of earnings.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although free access increases the number of visitors to museums, I believe that the collection of admission fees provides institutions with a significant source of income which further helps them to improve their facilities.'",

In my opinion, this contributes to issues concerning cultural disintegration and should be intervened by citizens alongside with assistance of the government of a particular country. \r\n\r\nThe main issues resulting from abandoning traditional festivals concern culture. More commercial holidays such as Christmas and Black Friday are gaining in popularity which naturally threatens smaller cultural groups and their festivals. For example, in China there are numerous ethnic groups living in remote areas that struggle to preserve their traditions over time as locals learn more about the outside world and leave their hometowns. As these groups disperse further, both results may impact the stories they hand down through generations, their language, traditional dishes and other aspects of culture. \r\n\r\nThe optimal remedies for the weakening of traditional cultures are for governments and individuals to actively encourage traditional festivals. Governments can make the greatest difference. For instance, states could fund organizations that aim to promote traditional festivals by staging local events and reaching out to older members of the community. Younger people could likewise attempt to engage more with their roots and connect with the sources of their culture. This occurs to some extent already when traditional festivals are advertised on social media to bring in wider audiences and greater attention. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the loss of folk events is a boon to globalization and injures the cultural identity of various groups.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some people think that with the increasing use of mobile phones and computers, people lose the ability to communicate face to face. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nIt is argued that the surge in phone and computer use is leading to a decline the people\u2019s abilities to communicate. In my opinion, the surge of modern technology devices cannot facilitate interpersonal communication.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the opponents consider that the ability of interpersonal communication loss is due to the following reasons. Firstly, the invention of Facetime can fully substitute the face-to-face conversations. Because of the improvement of technology, the technology devices enable people to distinguish subtle facial expressions. Moreover, emojis can convey emotions that are hard to express through texting. Messages do not always capture accurate feelings, therefore, the emergence of emojis can illustrate emotions vividly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that Face Time and emojis do not capture an individual\u2019s feelings. First of all, FaceTime cannot convey complete human emotions. Hiding behind a screen means that only a fraction of body language is visible, which could lead to misunderstanding. Secondly, the use of emojis as substitutes for genuine feelings is limited. In many circumstances, people will use emojis to decline conflicts to be polite or avoid embarrassed. Therefore, the emojis cannot convey a genuine feeling.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the surge in phone and computer use can weaken interpersonal communication skills, as neither Facetime nor emojis can comprehensively convey human emotions.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree.' \n 'Text': 'While some people opine that male and female students should be accepted by universities in the same quantity in every subject, I would argue with this phenomenon due to my firm convince that the gender factor is not crucial. In this essay, I plan to spotlight my point of view and substantiate it with examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this idea carries with it a highly actual principle of gender equality and equivalent rights for all human beings. For example, I have seen a movie recently about times when it was strange and unusual for women to become  university law students. Obviously, if those times had not passed, women would still have to fight for the right to study where they want. Without a doubt, no one is loud against this idea.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are faculties where the male students' number exceeds the female students' number, and this is natural for these specializations. For instance, the University of Sports and physical culture in my country has many subjects such as boxing, weightlifting and others where it is hard to find a woman student. In these subjects, it is impossible to maintain equality between students of different genders. If these institutes have to consider this parameter while maintaining competition among applicants, they will not be able to recruit the required number of students.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it is vital to keep  gender equality among people studying in institutes, I still believe that the discussed above aspect should not be considered  the topmost one while maintaining competition among individuals applying for the subject.'",

I believe both the ways have their own advantages. This essay will discuss both the methods and a conclusion at the end to support my view.\r\n\r\nFirstly, school is an important place for all the children because they learn the basics of their education in school. School is considered as a starting line for the children. These days, schools offer many new activities and learnings that can be useful for children in many ways. For example, if we take a look at various schools, we can clearly see that they offer a nice and quiet environment for the children where they can learn new things at ease. Many children start to learn by observing other children along with them and that's why schools are the best place to offer academic learning. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, there are many things which are not taught in schools. For example, basic human nature,  respecting elders, mother tongue and many other qualities which are taught by children's parents. School knowledge is limited upto academic and soft skills but the nurturing which is required for a child can only be experienced at home. There are many other learnings like rituals, and family procedures that are crucial for a child to learn at home.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe both school and home are equally important for a child's development. However, school is best for academic and soft skills learning while home is best for all other learning. This combination of both  places will work best throughout a child's learning journey.'",

While I acknowledge the benefits of this decision, it is a fundamentally negative development. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the advantages of the trend of moving to the metropolitan area are indeed in plain sight. Chief of these is that the accessibility of a high living standard in center is far easier than in the countryside. This is true that people can participate in different types of infrastructures such as building complexes, hospitals and schools, which provides them multiple choices compared to that of rural areas. Additionally,this can be seen in the way rural populations seek a job or attend university and try their best to keep staying in big cities which allows them to have better opportunities and a bright future that their hometown is unable to provide them. \r\n\r\nDespite the benefits mentioned above, I believe that the large community departure to center is a negative development for various reasons. The major drawback is the imbalance of populations between urban and rural areas which means  high pressure will be placed on big place and the less people live in the countryside.This leads to  high traffic congestion and more apartments and roads have to be built to afford the high density of the population.Furthermore, this migration negatively affects the environment and human life because of the uncountable amount of toxic gasses released from vehicles and manufacturers. These factors are directly harmful to human lungs and the planet has to deal with the increase of global warming. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although we should not ignore the positive impact of the increasing movement of rural populations to urban areas, this trend is contributing to the depletion of human health and pollution.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Many people believe money is a very important factor for achieving happiness. Others, however believe that money has nothing to do with happiness. Discuss both views.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, the debate over the significance of money in achieving happiness remains contentious. While some contend that financial wealth is essential for happiness, others argue that true happiness transcends material possessions. Both perspectives offer valuable insights into the complex relationship between money and happiness.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, proponents of the view that money is crucial for happiness emphasize the tangible benefits that financial wealth can provide. Individuals with ample financial resources are better equipped to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Moreover, they have the means to access luxuries and experiences that can enhance their quality of life, such as travel, entertainment, and leisure activities. Additionally, financial security affords individuals the freedom to pursue their passions and aspirations without the constraints of financial limitations. For instance, those with sufficient wealth may have the opportunity to pursue higher education, pursue career ambitions, or engage in philanthropic endeavors that bring fulfillment and joy.\r\n\r\nConversely, proponents of the opposing view argue that true happiness cannot be bought with money and stems from internal sources rather than external possessions. They contend that material wealth may provide temporary satisfaction but fails to address deeper emotional and psychological needs. Happiness, they argue, is rooted in factors such as meaningful relationships, personal growth, and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Moreover, the relentless pursuit of wealth can lead to a hedonic treadmill, where individuals constantly strive for more material possessions without experiencing lasting happiness. Instead, they suggest that cultivating gratitude, mindfulness, and contentment can lead to a more fulfilling and sustainable sense of happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate over the role of money in achieving happiness reflects the complexity of human desires and aspirations. While financial wealth can undoubtedly contribute to happiness by providing security and opportunities for enjoyment, it is not the sole determinant of one's overall well-being. True happiness, it seems, lies in striking a balance between material wealth and internal fulfillment, recognizing the importance of both external and internal sources of happiness.'",

Discuss and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There has been quite an obvious discussion around the topic of purchasing goods. It seems to be that a lot of people decide to go shopping at a shopping mall rather than the local trading centre. I believe that it is a negative for development and i will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there is no doubt that getting products from supermarkets can be more impressive, convenient and a good environment. This is because there is a variety types of goods can be corrected, which could be some import ones and also a buyer can buy everything they need just in one place. For example, younger persons in Thailand usually shop in malls where there is cooler air as they provide air-conditioners rather than markets that are open-air. As a result, a large number of owners of small shops have to shut down as they cannot face financial issues.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is worth pointing out that correcting items from local communities would be enjoyable, relaxing and healthy. This is based on the fact that most of the products in local markets are grown or made by sellers which could be fresher and non-chemical than large supermarkets. For instance, people in Thailand not only go shopping in a regional shops just for some goods, but they also seek to have a chat with their neighbours. Consequently, the neighbourhood's friendship could be developed while they are shopping.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we can observe that if most people continuously shop in supermarket, small shops which mostly owned by locals may have to be shut down as they cannot deal with financial problems.'",

What can be done to address this situation?' \n 'Text': 'It is said that children around the world are showing disrespectful behavior to older people. This phenomenon might stem from the habit of using smartphones during school hours. However, addressing more family activities can tackle the problem of disrespect.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be considered that smartphones can have a negative impact on children's attitudes toward adults. Since smartphones are addictive, children may prefer spending more time using them than hanging out with adults. As a consequence, it leads to an extension of the gap between family members, which affects the way children behave toward adults. Take Gen Alpha as a contextual example. Due to the development of entertainment technologies, children spend the majority of their time surfing the internet so often that they start to show misbehaving actions toward elders.\r\n\r\nAnother cause that must be taken into account is the educational curriculum. It is obvious that children spend more time at school than at home, so they are more social with their friends. Over time, they develop their personalities and behaviors with their friends, thinking that the way they treat their friends is the same as that of adults. Because of that, the way they act toward adults might not be appropriate and be considered disrespectful. For instance, Vietnamese parents have to suffer a lot when it comes to their children's misbehavior due to learning from friends at school.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it is a global issue, the problem of children disrespecting elders can be solved by organizing more family activities. It must be acknowledged that in order to teach children about their actions, parents can increase the value of family members through family work. By encouraging children to take part in activities, they will have some time away from smartphones, as well as increasing the value of the elders in the children's eyes. As a result, the gap between generations will be significantly smaller, and children will be more respectful toward older people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, smartphones and study hours are the roots of a lack of respect among children. Hence, organizing more family activities can enhance family relationships, which is the most effective solution to this worldwide issue.'",

More the ailing population in a country, more the government will have to spend on them for welfare.As an example, in Pakistan, the employees after retirement get a lot of money as pension which is doubled at age of seventy five years and often the benefits are given to the families of the deceased.All these expenses are born by the government which put more pressure on the earning lot by applying greater tax.In addition, many of these sick individuals are dependent on family members for their physical needs.This means more members of a community are unavailable for active job as they are bound to look after debilitated patients.\r\n\r\n                                      To summarize, getting an illness-free advanced age is a blessing for residents who may contribute to nation-building.Overall the merits of increased age outweigh few of its demerits.'",

Additionally, I argue that it will help ensure the safety of people in risky jobs, but it is also the major reason for the rising of unemployment.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that robots and artificial intelligence work more effectively than humans. To explain, while humans can only work from 8 to 10 hours per day, robots and AI work constantly for several days to meet the large requirement of products. For example, the Shoppee's shipping procedure is all made by automated machines instead of workers like before.\r\n\r\nThe lack of employees in some dangerous work is also raise considerably. In order words, the young generation now is not willing to work in dangerous conditions, they usually have trend to does office work which has a stable salary. It leads to a shortage of workers in risky jobs, so they have to utilise robots to do those jobs. For instance, currently, there is a repaired robot used to fix undersea cables which rare people want to do due to its high water pressure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the replacement of robots in dangerous jobs can be ensuring the safety of people who do risky jobs. This is because, their still several things which only can be done by people so to keep safe, robots and artificial intelligence are used to support humans in dangerous situations. Take the job of digging underground tunnels as an example, people can be using robots to investigate the conditions of soil and oxygen before digging to ensure the safety of workers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the enhancement of robots and AI in the workplace is also the major reason for the high-unemployed nowadays.

The first merit of a shopping center is local dwellers can go shopping more conveniently. It would enable them to purchase things in town without a long itinerary and pay for shipping. That allows individuals to get things at affordable costs and transport them home with less effort. Another reason is that shopping can provide employment. Local people can find work in retail to enhance their income to maintain their lives. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although public parks and sports facilities serve as a spot to provide exercise and social activities for citizens, I believe that shopping centers have an equally important role since these places open job opportunities and convenience for town residents.'",

What are solutions for this problem?' \n 'Text': 'Due to human activities, a great number of land and marine animals face extinction and this problem is worsening these days. There are some reasons why this phenomenon is occurring, and there are also some ways to tackle this issue.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are some factors which result in animal extinction. First and foremost, destroyed habitats of animals can be a reason. In order to develop and prosper, it is inevitable for countries to carry out deforestation and water pollution. These processes can eventually harm and destroy the habitats of wildlife. In addition, there are still many hunters who kill or hunt animal species. As they illegally kill or harm animals for sales, the number of animals decreases and results in extinction of them. Furthermore, the increased amount of discarded chemicals into water and soil may cause animal extinction.\r\n\r\nHowever, some solutions can be introduced to alleviate the issue. First of all, reforestation must be implemented. It is important to provide natural habitats for animals. People should plant more trees to form more forests for animals. Secondly, governments and authorities must create animal reserves to protect endangered animals. By having these facilities, animals can reproduce be protected in safe places. Lastly, strict regulations must be imposed for illegal hunting. Illegal hunters should identify harmful effects of their actions and should be punished heavily in order not to continue their wrong behaviour. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are more animals which are being extinct, I firmly believe that there are some ways to protect them. Thus, both individuals and governments should be aware of this problem and make some efforts to improve the current situation.'",

Besides, there are a few opinions that disagree with that statement because many people think that other problems are more serious. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss my opinion of both views.\r\n\r\nAs a person who lives in capital city, I feel the most destructive problem that my city has is the increasing amount of cars in the street every day. The traffic jams here in the city are very unfriendly. On average, we have to spend up to 2 hours just to travel 10 kilometres by private car or taxi. In addition, this unbelievable traffic occurs due to the lack of public transportation in the city. Consequently, the majority of people are taking their own vehicles to commute. Furthermore, all of these conditions lead to the raised level of pollution that will directly affect the lungs' health.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other problems are also aserious issues that still remain unsolved. For example, a bad schema of water irrigation in a city, so that there is a flood occurs around the city. Additionally, there is still a ghetto in an inappropriate surrounding that will spoil the city layout. However, solutions from the government in terms of these problems are not making the city better in recent times.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that all cities in this world have their own problems that are different from one another.

In the fullness of time,\r\n\r\n classroom teachers will be totally substituted for technology. \r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is no doubt that technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in classrooms these days. There are some people say that technology should take over the place of teachers. I firmly disagree with this idea because the cost will be expensive and cannot meet the individual needs of learners. \r\n\r\nReplacing teachers completely in the classroom with technologies is not feasible for school management as it costs a significant amount of money. Schools usually have limited funding, and replacing all educators with advanced technologies requires new equipment such as tablets with interactive touch screens, electronic white boards and cameras which enable school operators to monitor students. In this case, operating a high-tech classroom would be more expensive than having educators on site. Therefore, it would be impossible to replace educators.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, taking over personnel with technology may lead to the individual needs of students being unmet. It is because the learning skills and capabilities of every single student are different, without proper guidance and supervision from experienced trainers, it would be difficult to design tailored study plans to meet individuals' needs. For example, learners who have been diagnosed with ADHD should not be taught the same as other peers in the classroom, a detailed teaching strategy should be implemented by teachers to accommodate the needs of these special learners whereas technologies cannot do. Hence, having all teachers replaced by technologies may oversee learners who have special study needs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that teachers should be fully replaced by modern technologies because it cost over budget and usually do not meet the study needs of students who have special conditions.'",

While some people believe that a flat has negative effect for people who live in this place, I would argue that large apartment buildings are more helpful for people\u2019s lifestyles in this day. I will explain my reasons in this essay. \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that living in an apartment block can have a negative impact on people who prefer more living space. This is because some people would like to have more space for their families and outside areas for their lifestyles. For example, in Thailand, some families who have member more than 3 people prefer to have houses more than flats because they would like to have more space for their children. Also, some families have outside areas for their garden. As a result, an apartment block can not provide people do several activities.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that large apartment blocks and flats have many advantages for people\u2019s lifestyles in this day. This is based on the fact that apartments are built close to the city centre and can be close to the residents\u2019 work, shopping centre and transportation which can benefit for their lifestyles. For instance, Singapore has many apartment blocks for residents who would like to live near their workplace which can save them time. This is the reason why people prefer to live in flats more than a house. Consequently, apartment blocks can increase convenience for people who live in these facilities. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can observe that residents can be convenient while their living in large apartment buildings.

This trend is observable in many countries around the globe, and it raises a pertinent question as to why there is a lack of interest in science among students. This essay will examine the underlying reasons for this problem and its impact on society.\r\n\r\n      One of the primary reasons for the declining interest in science amongst students is the challenging curriculum and lack of proper guidance in schools. Students often find science subjects to be complex and difficult to understand, which can be daunting for those who do not have a natural inclination towards these subjects.\r\n\r\n       The consequences of this trend are far-reaching and have a significant impact on society. Firstly, there is a shortage of skilled professionals in the field of science, leading to a lack of innovation and research. This not only hinders technological advancement but also affects industries that rely heavily on science, such as healthcare and engineering. Furthermore, the dearth of professionals in science also leads to a brain drain, with many talented individuals seeking better opportunities abroad, which negatively impacts the growth of a country's economy. For instance, skilled workers tend to go to developed countries to earn higher wages.\r\n\r\n       In conclusion, the lack of interest in science subjects amongst students is a concerning problem that has far-reaching consequences for society. It is crucial for education systems to adopt more student-friendly and interactive teaching methods to foster interest in science from an early age.'",

Recent public debate has revolved around whether the focus should be on financing internal or external issues. While some argue that the government must prioritize the prosperity of their nation, I firmly believe that it is crucial to help other countries, particularly in the context of globalization. This essay will elaborate on this point of view.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize the interconnection nature of the global economy. In today\u2019s world, economic downturns in the country can have ripple effects. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the collapse of the housing market in the United States influenced globally, leading to recessions in numerous countries. Therefore, supporting other nations during economic downturns can ultimately benefit one\u2019s own country by stabilizing the global economy and preventing further economic disruptions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, addressing global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and poverty requires collective action and cooperation among nations.

It is good for both society and individual.

Furthermore, some people are not finishing their degrees, and some of them are still struggling in their work. Their salaries are not enough to support raising a child. Take me for example, after graduating from college, I lost my job four times. I do have a good job that I can do for a long time, not to mention marriage. That is the rich people's thing. Therefore, It is not a great idea for the youngest to marry someone. \r\n\r\nAnother point I would like to talk about is that many young men can not have a wife, because girls are picky nowadays. They want their husbands to be rich, handsome, kind, and so on. As a result, too many people are single. Women do not like most of the men. From my observation, I have seen so many young guys never have a romantic relationship in their entire lives. I think maybe it is good to marry in the early 20s, but they have to drop out of schools and face many difficulties. In the real world, a trend can be seen that most of us are not willing to marry, and the others who want to get married are the people who get married in their late 30s.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is hard to change our thinking. Young fathers and mothers have so many things need to consider if they have a baby. For most of them, they can not afford to live. People currently do not like to marry, and some of them are not interested in it. Overall, this is an idea that can fit today's beliefs.'",

A big sector of society thinks that freedom of speech in public media should not be limited by the government. In this essay, I will explain why I completely agree with this statement.\r\n\r\nThere are some reasons why freedom of expression has positive effects on our society. To begin with, when in the country individuals can express their opinions and ideas even about the government's politics, the state is very democratic. Therefore,  social cohesion is strong and public live in a healthy society. Additionally, almost in any country the constitution always provides freedom of speech for their citizens. Thus, the legislatures must not restrict people's right to speak, but if they do, it means that government machine monopolise politics and do not follow their own laws. Finally, folk should have an approach to controlling government, and one of the methods is through free public speeches. Hence, legislatures will scared to break the laws.\r\n\r\nHowever, liberty of speech needs to be limited, because crowd can use it for selfish purposes. First of all, billions of people use digital media, and most of them trust  what they read. So, public with bad motives, terrorists and others use this function of social media to implement acts of terror or to find trustful individuals to abuse them. On top of this, some people do not respect private life.

But, it is much more dangerous, what the government can do, if citizens will not have the right to free speech.'",

To my point of view being both sociable and qualified is needed to fulfill most of the jobs nowadays.\r\n\r\nAs far as knowledge and experience is concerned, some jobs do need specialities. For instance, if you want to take the chance to work as a doctor you should have a degree from a university, that you have been trained as a doctor and are qualified. Regarding this issue, the higher the rank of the university you studied in, the more chance you have to get better job-offers. Furthermore, being qualified and having experience on a special subject are crutial to some employers and they would not take the risk of unexperienced staff, since it may endangers their credit and respect. \r\n\r\nBeing able to socialize with others plays a pivotal role in everyones' life these days, especially if you want to take a job which is based on this quality. Salesmen or online customer supports, for example, they need to talk and persuade customers, whether to buy their products or reassure them, that they will have good service, as support for their goods, So having an extroverted personality could be the matter of winning or losing the chance to move up the carreer ladder in any kind of job.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that emploees should have special qualities such as being sociable and experience in all fields they are going to work in, and non of which is more important than another one.'",

Do you agree or disagree.' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that people should be prohibited from engaging in life-threatening sports or not. This essay agrees that these sports should be declared illegal because of the following reasons. Firstly, relying on these activities to make a living is not worth the money which can be earned through these sports and second, it is not a wise choice to pursue anything which puts a precious life in danger.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, most people involved in dangerous sports activity might argue that they can earn a good amount of money, and since they have performed it so many times, they are quite confident that it is safe for them. However, from my point of view, no matter how many times it has been practised, the risk of loosing a life is the same each time. Therefore, even though these activities pay well in terms of money, it not worth a precious life we have got.\r\n\r\nMoreover, any wise person who clearly understands the risk and return involved in these sports would never recommend doing them. The reason for that is we can try as many different alternatives as possible, if we are alive to do so. For example, if a person is not earning enough, he/she can upskill and find better options. Therefore, doing life-threatening activities just with the sole purpose of being rich is foolish in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, many individuals choose to engage in dangerous sports to earn a good amount of money, however, life is more precious than any material thing out in the world, and it is totally irrational to do anything for a few dollars where chances of losing a life are significantly high.'",

Some argue that it is better to spend more money to innovate in prevention rather than cure. personally, i believe it will be useful to find a way to foresee the trouble of the body and then stop it,therefore, i completely agree with this point of view, which can be supported by the reasons as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, finding a way to detect the trouble which would become an incurable disease,including cancer or diabetes is indispensable for  development of the medical science, otherwise, it can be deadly. In other words,an acute tumour would be deadly once it is detected and no more way or drug can cure it. However, the appearance of  preventive measures can detect it in advance making treating it possible. What's more, it would apparently reduce the pain of some diseases,for example, lung tumour, which makes patients can't breathe and pain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that investing in this area may have a potential impact on the cure or treatment field,and even spend double the money on it.In this regard,in my word,i believe that would not be a problem if we make good use of the medical research funding to  realise its ultimate value.According to the annual report of the Australian government ,almost 70% of citizens announced that there was a solid relationship between researching reasonably and expanding.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that it would be better to invest in preventive measures.In this case,governments and individuals should devote sufficient funding to addressing medical research, and science workers,especially  medical researchers should regulate it reasonably to avoid the misuse of funding.'",

I completely agree with this statement and elaborate on this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, new technologies massively changed the speed of news delivery. The invention of television and radio prepared humanity for the upcoming news revolution. Before the 19th century, newspapers were crucial for people. Newspapers, letters and rumours were the only source of information back then. In the 20th century with the help of radio and television, it became possible to hear news upon request right from home at any time of the day.  \r\n\r\nTo be more specific, the invention of the internet was a real game changer. Soon after the internet, new devices with direct internet connection became reachable and affordable to everyone.Today, a huge percentage of people have personal mobile phones or laptops. Thus, starting from this moment, everyone obtained a chance to create and read content from all possible places on Earth. In addition, it gave an opportunity to create articles and video reviews and share them through the internet at any time and any place.

Unemployment and corrupt government officials are the major causes of the significant rise in the crime ratio. It is necessary to make humans aware and make strict regulations for the rulers of the country to protect the economy. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most predominant extrapolation behind the excessive crime rate is unemployment in most nations. For instance, as per the reports of 2018, approximately 6.7% of the Indian population was living below the poverty line and this situation has been exacerbated in 2019, and 2020. If individuals are not able to earn enough for their living to fulfill their necessities due to the dearth of resources, they usually choose the wrong trajectory and end up becoming criminals. Hence, the lack of jobs is a primary reason that boosts criminal percentage. Another pivotal reason is the presence of some corrupt government leaders in the nation. There are some executives, who only care about money and they do not care for the well-being of their public, and they use black money to promote corrupt practices in the economy to maintain their power. Due to such cases, administration staff members who are already rich are earning well and the poor are suffering relentlessly and get involved in the line of criminals for their family needs.\r\n\r\nIt is enormously vital that an equal chance should be provided to all to get jobs so that the poor do not suffer due to money pressure from the richer sections of the society and this will help to control the rising crime rate to some extent. Public awareness plays a vital role in improving all the troubles in society, increasing crime rate is no exception. If the public knows about the corrupt government officials they can get together and raise their voices to change them, this will bring unity among the people along with this, it will be a huge step in eliminating the crime ratio. Hence, awareness and unity can work together to control this major issue in the countries.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the reasons along with the solutions mentioned above, it is clear that unemployment and government policies are contributing to an increase in the crime rate. Thus, the provided solutions can be applied to reduce this problem in the country.'",

Do you think this is positive or negative development?\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is a common fact that being a professional athlete requires consistency in practising. As an effort to support their athletes, some countries build certain sports centers which are specialized only for professional athletes. In this situation I strongly believe that providing these facilities brings more benefits compared to the negatives.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several advantages of building facilities only for professional athletes to practice. Firstly, it gives more flexibility for the athletes to set their practice schedule since no other strangers will use the facilities. Subsequently, they can have more time to practice and improve their skills. In addition, the use of an exclusive building lets athletes focus more on their practice because their fans will have no access to the facilities.\r\n\r\nBeside the positives, using an exclusive building also has some drawbacks. One disadvantage is that coaches will not be able to meet new sportsman in the field. For example, non-professional players will not use the facilities to practice while coaches will spend most of their time in the building. Unfortunately, the possibility for them to meet during practice is reduced. Another drawback is that the government will spend more money on the asset. The expenses are not only used when they build it but also the maintenance of the facilities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the negatives such as giving less chance for new players and gaining more expense, building exclusively facilities for athletes is more important for the country. The importance is due to the development of the athletes' skills as their practice schedule and focus will not be distracted.'",

In many countries,\r\n\r\n students are independent from their families, or their parents are not wealthy enough to afford their education. Therefore, a part-time job can greatly contribute to the financial position of a student. It may be an essential factor in permitting study in the first place.

This, along with the development of modern industry, has led to higher levels of population in many city. As a result, the local environment and people\u2019s health are being negatively affected.\r\n\r\nCities with a large population are often especially polluted. This is because there is a greater concentration of cars and industry in a small area. Cities with both a large number of cars and a poor public transport system are often in a particularly bad situation as they suffer from high levels of noise and air pollution. Other cities, which have economies that rely on industry, have to deal with problems created by manufacturing. These can include air, water and soil polution, both locally and in a wider area aroung the city.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these two factors, pollution can have negative effects on both the local environment and people\u2019s well-being. Increased air pollution is often linked to a number of health concerns, particularly breathing problems. Both water and soil pollution can damage or kill a number of plant and animal species, and ultimately, this may affect the quality of the food available for human. Lastly, both transport and industry can increase noise and light pollution in cities. This can mean that people get poor sleep and their health may be affected by this.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some cities are becoming more polluted because they are becoming more populated which leads to growing amount of traffic and industrial production.

I wholeheartedly support this notion, as I believe that young minds are more adept at embracing fresh concepts and possess heightened learning capabilities. Furthermore, by the time they reach high school, they are already familiar with foreign languages, alleviating the pressure of additional subjects.\r\n\r\nResearch confirms that young children exhibit a remarkable capacity for absorbing new information.

Thus, initiating language studies at an early age is more logical.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, high schoolers grapple with a demanding curriculum, and the inclusion of a new language course would only add to their academic load, potentially leading to frustration and diminished focus. Consequently, the intended goal of mastering a second language may remain unrealized, necessitating extra time and effort.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that introducing new subjects, such as a second language, to children at a young age is paramount, given their heightened aptitude for learning and mastering these subjects in comparison to older individuals.'",

Is this a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'A notable development has been growing throughout the countries in recent years \u2013 more individuals are aiming for their personal goals and achievements instead of collective interests. Although various opinions stem from this trend, I believe that it is highly disadvantageous. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, individualism lets people feel challenged to integrate into society. To be specific, it often results in a lack of togetherness and increased selfishness. Thus, it makes individuals feel lonely. To illustrate, when people solely focus on their own tasks and situations, they are likely to excel in their fields: however, they lack a sense of belonging. Moreover, they do not know how to communicate with others, or how to solve group problems. Hence, only concentrating on their personal rewards or aims is dangerous as it is a driving force behind decreased communication skills and togetherness.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the nation should never neglect the value of collective interests as they are beneficial to mental health. It is undeniable that collective mindset brings a sense of belonging which is a key point of living a harmonized life with others. For example, we are living in a very socialised world with various people and thus, we need to learn how to communicate with each other. Having collective thinking helps to improve social skills and secure emotional stability. Also, a notable study conducted by Korea University revealed that possessing a sense of togetherness is firmly favorable to preventing mental illnesses such as dementia. Therefore, nations should be collective instead of being selfish. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although endeavouring people\u2019s personal goals and ambitions can be positive and negative at the same time, I believe that the bad impacts override the merits.

In my opinion, putting too much pressure on children from their parents to succeed brings a devastating blow to their children. \r\n\r\nIrrefutably, children can be dependent on their parents. This is because the parents provide all things related to their children such as making study plans, researching information about homework, and preparing daily meals. This obviously leads them to become passive and this in turn results in negative issues, including anxiety, depression, and loneliness without their parents.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, children who are under too much pressure from their parents struggle with significant stress. In actual fact, studies undertaken by experts have revealed that plenty of children are forced to extremely long hours study for achiving a high-level performance by parents on a daily basis. This, therefore, brings about exhausted physical and mental status. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, appropriate pressures are significantly beneficial to children. In other words, since having a chance to think about success leads to making life goals, parental guidelines considerably support children\u2019s dreams and goals come true, so those are likely to strive to study for their objectives.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, appropriate pressures are significantly beneficial to children but children can be dependent on their parents and children struggle with significant stress. Thus, putting too much pressure on children from their parents to succeed brings a devastating blow to their children.'",

Western countries such as America and Britain have relatively shorter office hours compared to Asian countries. Some claim economic development is superior in those nations with longer working hours. I wholeheartedly agree with this nation, as I will elaborate the following. \r\n\r\nLonger working hours often can bring higher productivity. Nowadays, economic competition has become more severe. The country which has faster and larger productivity stands up easily. Take Taiwan for example, people there tend to work more than 12 hours a day, along with fewer national holidays in comparison with Western countries, and it is undeniable that Taiwan\u2019s electric industry plays an indispensable role globally. This could be due to Taiwanese hard working characteristics. Additionally, economic stability and prosperity can also result from a long working time. This work pattern brings opportunities for jobs, contributing to the reduction in unemployment rate.  However, it still has certain drawbacks.\r\n\r\nWorking for a long time may cause potential physical and mental health problems. Worker\u2019s rest and sleep time can be deprived, leading to harmful health outcomes. For instance, Japan is well-known for long work hours. Though it is one of economic successful nations, its suicide rate which is related to work has climbed recently. Consequently, health issues should not be underestimated, especially in those nations that have this long working pattern. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, countries with longer office hours enable them to have higher productivity and be more competitive, making them have better economic development. However, sometimes it is at the expense of the employer's health, and people should be more aware of this issue to ensure the country's economic sustainability.'",

I strongly believe that this can lead to a better environment for us and the next generations and setting some rules is the only way to prevent its side effects.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the amount of trash produced by houses is not enough recycled and this can be addressed by making some legal requirements. On the one hand, by setting some rules in order to force city duelers to be aware of recycling home waste it is beneficial for them. Firstly, some strict rules should be implemented to encourage society to buy the manufacturers which are made of recycled materials. For instance, people will be able to save more money by purchasing items which are manufactured with recycled materials because of the less expenditure that these products have.  \r\n\r\nAnother useful law is to implement some fines for people who do not care about separating their recyclable and non-recycleable trash from each other.

This trend has sparked contrasting opinions, with advocates and critics each representing valid arguments. This essay will analyze both perspectives and subsequently offer a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason for supporting the teenage as the best life and the prominent one is that this life is stress-free because, at this stage of life, peers do not have any tension on their minds for earning money or livelihood as their guardians are working for them to fulfill their necessities along with their desires. Furthermore, at this stage of life juveniles grow mentally as well as physically and these are the most precious days of their life-span. \r\n\r\nHowever, in adulthood, individuals get the freedom to make their own decisions for a better future. They do not get any pressure from their parents and are held liable for their actions. Moreover, if they are working and earning good, they do not need to get approval from anyone to buy items for them as they are financially independent. Hence, it is apparent why many people think the adult age is more happiest.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, young age is the happiest part of one's life cycle because it not only provides freedom to the person but also helps them to learn new chapters of life every day by meeting new people and this stage assists humans to innovate their minds as well by discovering new trajectory to make their business more lucrative. Ultimately, both age-stages have their merits, and the better approach aligns with the comfort level of the individual. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the matrimonials mentioned above teenage is a relaxed age but with the least freedom, but a young age provides financial security along with the right to make decisions. Hence, each approach offers unique benefits, but adulthood is better as in my opinion.'",

The usage of such substances has some reasons, such as becoming more beautiful or being famous and also consequences on the overall well-being and society,like the loss of natural beauty and health-related issues. This essay will discuss both the causes and effects of the trend.\r\n\r\nThe foremost cause of this issue is mostly considered a desire to be more appealing and attractive. To be more specific, some individuals accept whiter skin as a symbol of the ideal appearance, so it leads people to buy these creams. Furthermore, today most celebrities opt for using lighting products and participate in endorsement events after which it pulls the attention of the public. Consequently, the figure for the brightening cream usage is increasing day by day due to the promotion of the companies for getting more benefits.\r\n\r\nOne of the profound and possible consequences behind the problem is related to health concerns. Those who overuse such creams damage their natural appearance. In other words, it results in dermatologic diseases which sometimes make it impossible to return to the initial state of the skin. It has a detrimental impact not only on the skin  but also on overall well-being. To elaborate, if  skin cancer occurs, other diseases will be inevitable.

Why is this happening?\r\n\r\nDo you think this will have a positive or negative impact on society?' \n 'Text': 'In digital era, the advancement of technology has led to the development of robots and artificial intelligence systems that are increasingly capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans. This trend is driven by various factors, including the desire for increased efficiency, cost reduction, and the potential to minimize human error. However, while the rise of robots in the workplace promises to revolutionize industries, it also raises significant questions about its impact on society.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary reasons behind the development of robots and AI in the workplace is the quest for efficiency. Machines can often perform repetitive tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, leading to increased productivity and reduced operational costs for businesses. For example, in manufacturing plants, robots can work around the clock without the need for breaks or rest, leading to higher output levels and decreased production time.\r\n\r\n Another reasons are that robots and AI have the potential to minimize human error, particularly in high-risk industries such as healthcare and transportation. By automating certain processes, these technologies can help prevent accidents and improve safety standards. In healthcare, for instance, AI-powered diagnostic systems can analyze medical images with greater accuracy than human professionals, leading to more precise diagnoses and better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the development of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges for society. While automation can increase efficiency and productivity, it also raises concerns about job displacement and inequality. To mitigate these challenges, it is essential to invest in education and training programs to prepare workers for the changing labor market and ensure that the benefits of automation are shared equitably across society.'",

In light of this, I contend that this event takes place due to the increment in efficiency and sales. From my perspective. I think this innovation plays a crucial role in our daily life and have a positive effect on my study and  work in the future.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognised that robots and artificial intelligence help businesses to improve productivity and work performance. which is really vital for each company to gain more profit. Besides, this technology also limits  time and strength, which helps employees save  time to do  important other things.

For instance, in China's logistics, they prefer to use machines in the period of production instead of labours, which helps them not only s\r\n\r\nave  time but also gain more efficiency. Therefore, the invention of this technology brings various benefits to our life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to social impact, it is evident that the promotion of global innovation brings to us various positive changes. Firstly, artificial intelligence can increase the efficiency of work which helps employees handle  repetitive tasks across an organization so that the labourers can focus on creative solutions and complex problem-solving. Moreover, robots are very supportive in helping scientists solve some difficult mathematics so that they can get rid of physical limitations better than humans. As a result, robot existence in the workplace not only causes  time consumption but also reinforces scientific progress, which helps produce some global breakthroughs. For example, look at the BioC company which is known by the medical business in France. The scientists here only concentrate on experimenting with the data whereas the other tasks such as identifying a number of cells are completed by robotic factors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  robots and artificial intelligence have developed in the company.

Thanks to the massive growth in computing power and data available, machine-learning algorithms have become more sophisticated. The automation of tasks that previously required human labour would now be possible. For example, artificial intelligence applications have been used in human resource management to streamline certain aspects of the recruitment process. In the field of education, processes of grading and assessing student's learning abilities can be carried out through automated systems. Most people nowadays have virtual assistants such as Siri from Apple or Google Assistant from Google to arrange schedules, send emails or take notes on their behalf. These transformations can open up new opportunities for society and help the individual better manage their lives. In my individual's views, despite many great advances, artificial intelligence technologies are still very far from possessing an algorithm that is capable of replicating human emotions. The best artificial intelligence devices can do so far is to mimic basic facial expressions and to voice these concerns.  However, this is no different from displaying an error message when there is an obstruction in their pre-programmed workflow.

So the population that used to live life as simply as possible and in the most effortless way  reduce the amount of time that spending on bicycles because of needs for physical activities.\r\n\r\n To tackle this problem,  governments should start programs that encourage people to practice their bikes instead of other ways ,flexible times for starting their work day and healthy meals for those who service their personal health method. For illustration, they can introduce laws that support bike travellers and give them this opportunity to travel between their home and office in a safe way so  suggesting adaptable starting work hours could help them to finish their journey in the safest way.\r\n\r\n All in all, in my view cycling, is a really advantageous form of transport, however, it is going to be unpopular gradually and the authorities can solve it by introducing some laws and some opportunities for users to power up their motion to handle it.'",

In order to\r\n\r\nbecome integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their\r\n\r\nold ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behavior.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is no doubt that these days immigration become increasingly favourable. The question is, is it really important to migrate and what are the costs? In this essay, I am going to discuss the new trend of people being transformed totally into another country as well as the advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, I will draw my own conclusion regarding  this subject.\r\n\r\nIn order of advantages, the latest research showed that the people of developing countries that are integrated in modern nations have experienced easier lifestyle situations. The main reason given to support this claim is that once the people are involved in the biggest countries, the services presented will be greatly facilitated. In other words, people will avoid time and effort which is more likely to be consumed in their own countries. Therefore, they prefer to leave their places wishing for an easier life.\r\n\r\nHowever, this way of travelling witnessed numerous drawbacks. Firstly, transformed people will be always considered as non-loyal individuals as they leave their original homeland. In other words, despite the comfort of life, they will always experience  homesickness due to the distance from their loved ones and their neighbourhood. Secondly, it is difficult to integrate into a new culture and change your original behaviour and language. For example, people immigrating into China will take a long time to understand the lifestyle and sometimes it might be impossible and risky. \r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, although there are several beneficial aspects regarding  immigration, it is not easy to leave your homeland and there are several problems you will be facing if you decide to take such a huge step. Therefore, governments must increase the awareness of both sides of their people and ease the services to save their population.'",

I think this may pose a threat to their health and waste their time, although people can have opportunities to find useful methods. \r\n\r\nThese tests will lead to potential dangers to their bodies. Many people are allergic to something such as nuts, so when they try new medicines, they may be unaware that these goods may cause damage to their health. For instance, if a patient who is allergic to apples takes a medication containing nutritions which comes from apples, he/she will feel uncomfortable and even need an ambulance. In daily lives, their common doctor will prevent them from having these things because they are familiar with their patients. \r\n\r\nThis thing may also be responsible for a waste of time for people. Trying new treatments and obtaining the results can cost a lot of time but finally, they may find these treatments are useless. So they fail to cure themselves and lose their valuable time. There are lots of civilians trying times and times, however, they earn nothing and just waste their time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trying new things gives people chances to find the right methods. Human beings have magic bodies and nowadays nobody knows everything about our bodies. As a result, no one can make sure that they give the appropriate medicines and treatments to their consumers. So if the one keeps trying different ways, he/she may find what he/she wants at last--if the right method has been invented! \r\n\r\nTo sum up, trying different medicines and curations alloww people to be likely to find the ways that are suitable to themselves, but this will present a challenge to their bodies and just be a waste of time.'",

Competition gives the best outcomes, but sometimes shows the worst results. In this essay, I will examine how this trend brings about both benefits and drawbacks.\r\n\r\n One of the main advantages of trying to be better than compansions is assistance to developing society and personnel. That is to say, The more competitive they are and the more they want to do well, the better their skills will improve. For example, in high school in South Korea, students are graded on the scale of their studies, owing to this, children always compare their scale to peers and have a desire to grow than before. For this reason, they try to study harder.\r\n\r\n However, if everyone in society were eager to beat someone then collaboration, I believe it would have a harmful effect on both individuals and the nation. If they learn only competition throughout the entire study period, it means they don't learn how to interact, care, and cooperate with others, and it will have a negative impact on their social life as  adults. In addition to, they feel blue or have low self-esteem easily because of comparing to peers. For instance, young people feel like they are not good enough because they are always focusing on what others are doing better.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, it is certain people benefit from competing with others. Nevertheless, from my perspective, the negative consequences are too significant to disregard. Thus, it would be a good idea for the school to teach both competition and cooperation so that everyone could learn more balanced thoughts in life.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people.\r\n\r\nWhy might this be the case?\r\n\r\nDo you think this is a positive or negative situation?' \n 'Text': 'It is no doubt that possession of a house is often considered to be an essential aspect of life. Therefore some people firmly believe that having their own living places would be more advantageous than renting one. The causes of this tendency will be discussed and the benefits will be argued. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main reason why owning a home is vital for individuals is because it provides a sense of security and stability. Rental housing can frequently be unpredictable as landlords may raise rental prices and decide to sell property. For instance, a family rents an apartment for several years, in which a comfortable life has been established: children attend schools nearby and parents have installed friendly relations with local residents. However, the landlord unexpectedly bursts with the informing them to vacate the flat since he has decided to live there himself. Therefore, it is much better to have their own residential building due to the fact that homeowners control their houses and are not dependent on the whims of landlords. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it is a positive trend not only because gives a sense of permanence and belonging but it also can be a good investment. Over time estate becomes more expensive, which means that homeowners can potentially make a profit if they sell their homes later. As an illustration, during the housing boom in the early 2000s, the reality of many people who owned an apartment in attractive locations increased dramatically. Hence, having an own house has many advantages. \r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the economic stability and safety convince individuals to buy a house instead of renting it. Home ownership gives homeowners a sense of security and stability and can also be a good investment. It plays an integral role in citizens\u2019 lives. Moreover, owning a flat is a goal that many people around the world strive for, and it's worth it.'",

While these social skills could improve employee management and bring effective networking, these could social skills could not determine exact qualification and abilities. \r\n\r\nWhat extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Recently, more and more people have been paying attention to social skills.There are people who say that social skills are the most important additional qualification for success. I firmly believe that these skills are really necessary to stay in a good position in the workplace. In this essay, I will present my point of view. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason I support this phenomenon is that many companies find employees who have good communication skills. such people have a lot of self-confidence to communicate with recipients. For example, in sales and marketing jobs, employees must rely on their own strength to convince customers by advertising their products.After that, their profits will increase when the number of customers increases.Moreover, in multinational jobs, employees have to communicate with foreigners.In such cases, personal contact is more important. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnother reason I agree with this statement is that satisfactory behavior plays an important role in the workplace. In an expanded industry, people work in a team and they have a leader.If the manager and the employees treat each other badly, the project cannot be completed successfully. For example, in an IT-related job, one person cannot complete the entire project in the shortest possible time. Moreover, they solve it with the help of 12 or 14 employees. In this case, acceptable behavior can create good relationships and give energy.In addition, you can share the problem with others if the other person behaves very well. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n To sum up, nowadays people can't do anything well due to a lack of social skills. if people have skills such as communication skills and good behavior, as well as academic skills.they will succeed in their professional life'",

While there are the number of individuals who hold the idea that stars should not be constantly followed by the media and to give them privacy, others contend that this is the fame they have earned so there is no harm in doing so. I will discuss both the views in following paragraphs providing my opinion at the end.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand number of people think that the media should respect the privacy of celebrities and  not follow them to click on their photos wherever they go. Everyone holds a right to have privacy during their personal life movements and the same applies to superstars as well. For instance, when celebrities do not want to reveal  their life events they should be given privacy. Being constantly watched by sometime is sometimes very traumatic, which leads to  unwanted stress in life.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that their stardom is because of the media\u2019s attention by keeping them always in lime lite. Therefore many think that famous celebrities reach  that level with the support of the media and the love of fans, hence it is righteous to know about their every movement. If favourite star gets married privately, this might leave a negative sentimental effect on fans. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although fans are interested to know about their star\u2019s routine life, in my opinion they deserve to live dignified and respected private lives with their family and loved ones.

It can be rest, culture, or business because people can do all sometimes with their schedule. Therefore they do not want to change their schedule. On the other hand, others prefer to be spontaneous because they want to only get rest and enjoy. I strongly believe that we can prefer both according to our situation and I going to explain some specific reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, discipline is so important while doing the program because if you change your activity you can be late or lose your real program or job. For example,  some business person travel too much for their job. They join some activities which are interesting if they have time  that travel. Of course, they do not want to change their vacation activities because they go  there for specific reasons if they change their program maybe they can lose their real job. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people do not like going on holiday according to any program and love too much spontaneity. The reasons for that are first, it can be so exciting because you do not know what you can do. Second, it can be so fun for people to enjoy without the program. Third, you can meet different people whom you do not know. For instance, one of my friends went from  Gaziantep to Antalya. he went walking and hitchhicking for cars. He told me it was a really amazing trip because I met a lot of different people on the way. Of course, it had a bad side. For example, you can see dangerous people.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, to stay in the plan or without any plan we can couse both according to our goal. . In my opinion, people choose too much spontaneous travel to enjoy.'",

What is your opinion?' \n 'Text': 'There is a prevailing notion that temporary jobs offer greater flexibility and freedom compared to full-time employment, allowing individuals to allocate their time as they please. While it is true that temporary employment can yield a substantial income, I contend that the stability and security provided by full-time positions outweigh the benefits of temporary work.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, individuals engaged in temporary jobs enjoy the flexibility to balance work and personal life. However, the unpredictable nature of their earnings often renders saving money challenging, leaving them vulnerable in times of financial need. For instance, in emergencies such as unexpected medical expenses, having a stable income becomes indispensable. According to recent statistics, over 60% of individuals in temporary positions struggle to save money due to fluctuating incomes. In my country, securing loans for significant investments like real estate typically necessitates proof of stable employment and income.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, temporary employment can be advantageous for those adept at financial management and time allocation. Despite the fluctuating income, individuals must exercise prudence in budgeting and expenditure. Moreover, the surplus time available can be utilized for self-improvement endeavors, such as acquiring new skills or languages. While additional job opportunities may augment earnings, effective time management becomes paramount. Transitioning between jobs smoothly can also be challenging; however, with proper planning and foresight, individuals can mitigate these challenges.\r\n\r\nIn light of the aforementioned considerations, the conclusion becomes apparent. While temporary employment facilitates a favorable work-life balance and offers opportunities for personal development, it also entails inherent risks and uncertainties. Therefore, I advocate for full-time employment as it provides a dependable income foundation and greater financial security.'",

What best measures can be taken for it' \n 'Text': 'In today\u2019s digital age, many young people regularly spend more of their lives indoors. This essay will first suggest that the biggest problem caused by this phenomenon is the current state of technology and then present advice to limit the overuse of electronic devices. the most feasible solution.\r\n\r\n     The foremost problem caused by the development of the technological age is electronic devices with addictive games. millions of people around the world spend too much time playing games when they are at home and most of those games take a lot of time to complete. The consequence is that it affects each person's lifestyle, making them feel lazier and want to stay home and play games instead of going out with some friends. For example, Today's games have online features that allow many people to play together. In an online game, this has increased the number of children or teenagers who want to stay at home and play games with friends but do not want to go out and play with them.\r\n\r\n     It's hard to deny that parental advice and action is the best solution currently. To explain, Parents should advise or manage their children to consider using electronic devices for entertainment, limit gaming to no more than three hours a day and convince them with some outdoor activity. For instance, Parents should regularly spend time with their children or take them on picnics or participate in other outdoor activities with them, especially team building games that help increase family relationships and stay away from children's electronic devices.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, spending too much time at home can have many negative effects on children or adolescents.

Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that we should increase the prices of sugar products so that less sugar will be eaten. I think that this may cause damage to the sugar industry and cause people to live unhappy lives, although people can be healthier.\r\n\r\nThis idea can pose a threat to the sweet-food manufacturers because there will be fewer people buying their goods. As we all know, the higher the price of an item is ,the less customers buy it. So if we make sugary products more expensive, a lot of people will abandon them and buy other products to enjoy themselves and as a result, the sweet food industry will fail to sell their products and be endangered. For example, citizens may prefer to buy more fast food like chips to have fun instead of sugar drinks or foods. The damage to the sugar industry may also lead to the unemployment of workers. \r\n\r\nThe higher price may also be responsible for an unhappy life. It is evident that sweet foods and beverages are the favourite goods of many civilians and eating sugar is a good way to enable people to feel happiness. So when we raise the prices of sugary products, fewer people can afford them and they lose a method to satisfy themselves. This will result in a worse life, especially for the poor-- they have few methods to have fun and one of the main ways is prohibited.\r\n\r\nHowever, people may have better bodies if they take in less sweet things.

However, some think that these activities are not beneficial for a child\u2019s mental health' \n 'Text': 'In modern society, it is much easier for children to get computer games and spend more time on TV than before. Besides, parents are busy finishing and handling their work. As a result, they do not have enough time to accompany their children. And parents will use TV and games to accompany their children. Thus, children waste a lot of time on this electronic entertainment. Is it a negative effect on children's mental abilities? To me, I agree with this point. I think watching TV and playing computer games are negative on children's mental abilities.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, watching TV and playing computer games cause children to reduce thinking. TV programs and computer games provide numerous images and sounds. Children do not have the opportunity to imagine and create their thinking. They lose the opportunity to think and grow up. It will affect children's mental abilities. By contrast, activities like reading or drawing develop many areas of the brain and help children to think and imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, children will decrease interaction with other people because of spending much time watching TV and playing computer games. When children spend a lot of time watching TV and playing computer games all day, they will not have time and the opportunity to play outdoors with other people. Physical activity also helps with brain development. Therefore, children should be discouraged from watching TV and playing computer games.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, our bodies and minds need to move and think. If we stop them moving, our bodies and minds will get worse. Therefore, we should help children's mental abilities through reading and drawing instead of spending too much time watching TV and playing computer games.'",

Some people claim that all of us ought to buy printed newspapers or books, especially the older generations; however, others believe that we don\u2019t need to buy something because we can easily get information on social media or our electronic devices. I concur with the second debatable topic for several reasons.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, without a shadow of a doubt, buying printed things in today\u2019s world is a challenging thing for youngsters because they don\u2019t know how to find a book or a newspaper. This is because they don\u2019t need to go to a library or a grocery store. They can easily find whatever they want in online markets. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t say the same thing for the old generation; newspapers are the most precious thing for them. According to an article that I read, some experts say that for an old person, reading newspapers is the most crucial thing they do during the day. Moreover, 80 percent of the elderly spend their money on reading.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I said in the beginning, teenagers don\u2019t need to buy a newspaper because some of them don\u2019t even follow the daily news. According to research, only 20 percent of teenagers follow the daily news day by day. Therefore, the purchasing power of newspapers and books has decreased for the last ten decades.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I strongly agree that if we want to learn news, we can easily and quickly get it from social media.'",

As a result, the citizens of the society are not able to live their lives peacefully. The situation is complicated by the fact that people find it difficult to recognize criminals from normal persons in the city. As a result, the sense of trust can be seriously damaged and this causes major problems for city residents. In other words, people fail to attend social activities, go to their workplaces or even go on holidays. Therefore, a large section of the community will suffer the consquences of not punishing the criminals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of people claim that the influencing environmental factors and incentives of criminals to commit crimes should always be taken into consideration before deciding on their punishment.

As for online research, nearly half of the young generations who come from poor families cannot pay a fee for the network. It is optimal that if the government spend taxes on libraries, this time more people may utilize this staff\u2019s amenities, including using technological appliances in order to search a relevant website.\r\n\r\n    However, using money on means of transportation can be an ideal way to supply people with a comfortable environment. A growing number of people believe that it is more prevalent to get more opportunities on public transport as their numbers are limited. For example, some people, including me argue that it is the better option for preventing crowded places which are caused by having more people than necessary. In addition, some people do not have any money to utilize public transport like buses, or underground. It can be the better way, if poor people do not have to pay any money for consuming transport.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I believe that both aspects are important to make our life a brilliant and beautiful place to live. Therefore, the government should spend tax money on both public libraries and transport.'",

Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an aging population outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, global populations are experiencing a significant increase in life expectancy, leading to a growing proportion of elderly citizens in many societies. While some perceive this demographic shift as advantageous, others express concerns about its potential challenges. This essay will examine both the benefits and drawbacks of an ageing population, ultimately arguing that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThere are notable advantages to a larger elderly population. Firstly, older individuals often possess a wealth of experience and skills that can mitigate workforce shortages, particularly in sectors experiencing labour scarcity, as exemplified by Taiwan\u2019s workforce challenges. Additionally, seniors tend to have higher disposable incomes, which can stimulate economic growth through increased consumption and investment.\r\n\r\nConversely, there are also significant challenges associated with an ageing populace. One concern is the strain it places on healthcare systems, particularly regarding the financing of health insurance programs. As the proportion of elderly individuals requiring medical care rises, younger generations may face increased financial burdens to sustain public healthcare. Moreover, the growing demand for long-term care facilities for seniors with health issues can overburden caregivers, leading to elevated stress levels within the healthcare workforce.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while an ageing population presents various challenges, such as healthcare strain and caregiver stress, its advantages in bolstering the workforce and stimulating economic activity outweigh these drawbacks. It is imperative for policymakers to address these challenges proactively while harnessing the potential benefits of an ageing society.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Parents are in a crucial position of affecting their children directly and it is acknowledged parenting is important in children\u2019s development. So, I totally disagree with this statement. Of course, parents can help with their kid\u2019s homework, but children should have to learn self-management and problem-solving abilities. \r\n\r\nThese days, it is on the table that children are becoming too much dependent on their parents. They learn how to manage themselves from their parent\u2019s behavior and how their parents treat them. Spending time with their children is important. Therefore, parents should spend time with their kids in a productive and efficient way. For example, going for a walk in the park, having dinner together, or doing something active and enjoyable, not helping homework.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, they need to improve problem-solving skills when they are young. They can realize how can they solve various problems more wisely and efficiently later on. Thus, they would be able to deal with any problem or concern they may face such as those related to relationship or work. For instance, they can learn many things when they do homework by themselves, such as societal, mathematical, scientific, even cultural concepts. Children can learn how to approach each problem when they are doing assignments alone. Parents could encourage their kids to discuss with other prople when they face difficult problems or don\u2019t have any clue about them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that parents should help their kids with their homework.

From my point of view, this viewpoint may be a negative trend, which provides some drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThe major reason why folks prefer to be self-employed rather than to work for a certain company is that the income that they obtain from doing a routine job is not enough. To illustrate, in Thailand, the minimum rate of salaries for those who have a bachelor's degree is 15,000 baths per month. As a result, a lot of people who have recently graduated from universities chose to be self-employed. Furthermore, many people would not like to encounter the awful working atmosphere. In other words, some office workers can not be tolerant of unfavourable behavior of their bosses and co-workers. As a consequence, they decided to resign and begin to run their own businesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the obvious disadvantages of being self-employed is that business owners must address numerous hardships by themselves. In simple terms, if they face any problems, they have to find solutions to tackle those issues by themselves. On top of that, business owners still have some expenditures even if their businesses experience a financial loss. That is to say, although their businesses do not have profits, they still have to pay for their employees, raw materials, and even the rent in some cases.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there are numerous reasons why people presently choose to run thier own businesses rather than doing a routine job, and this trend may offer some disadvantages.'",

Agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is believed that friends play a more important role in an adolescent\u2019s  life  than teachers or parents. I agree with this opinion. \r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that they share more  commonalities with peers than with parents.  They possess similar traits and characteristics like creativity or being driven \uff0cand most of them are facing similar difficulties: the pressure of getting into a decent university ,  finding a promising job or the confusion about their passions or their identity. Thus, the young generation would most likely think that friends of a similar age can better appreciate their position/stand in their shoes, providing them more practical suggestions than parents. In this case, they tend to be more open to friends and willing to follow their advice. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is related to social and emotional perspectives.  For one thing, most young people are uncertain about many aspects ( social \u7684A) in life and would worry about making mistakes. Such fear would cause them to assume that what the majority of their friends do is correct and end up imitating their thoughts and behaviour to seek a sense of certainty, but they would resist copying parents due to the age gap and different exposures to life. For another, as younger people are also afraid of feeling lonely and isolated/ do not want to feel being left behind, conforming to friends\u2019 behaviour helps them get along with friends and develop a strong bond and sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, young people are more likely to be affected by friends than by adults due to their shared difficulties and the desire of belonging to a group and feeling assured.'",

Other people opine that we have to keep them going no matter how. I think we should keep those programs going, and I will elaborate on my point of view in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the space program is vital because it shows how the technologies advance. In the 1960s, the first man has been to the moon. After that, our space programs did not have any breakthroughs, because the cost was too high. The US government can not afford those explorations. Other nations did not have good technologies like America to go to space. Instead of funding this, the USA authority focused on other important things such as finance, economy, defense, and so on in order to keep being the most powerful country in the world in the following years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, China nowadays is improving in its science, engineering, techniques, and the like. Thus, their space missions have been successfully completed many times. Elon Musk is a person who is eager to launch rockets, and his dream is to send the first people to Mars. This is a tough goal, but Mar is a planet and it has so many minerals. If we can use them, maybe we can be rich. We can also use resources from other asteroids, and it is unlimited.

From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the former.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why the pupils should study all subjects at school is because of the dramatical requirement of educational qualification and the demand for employment, the pupils currently ought to study all subjects in the class in order to broaden their general knowledge. This is because it is undeniable that studying plays an important role in setting up an advanced career for children in the future. Owings to this, the children ought to study all subjects at school in order to absorb basic insights. After that,  they can study other higher qualifications such as high school, and university easily. For example, The USA, which is the most cutting-edge country in educating students from the beginning, usually focuses on teaching in  class and ultimately becomes a rich country with high-quality human resources.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that studying favourite subjects will decrease stress for students and create interesting stimulation in studying. The reason is that it is true that the most favourite subjects  children always attract miracles and concentration on studying. In addition, these favourite subjects not only stimulate creative things in studying, but  also decreases stress for the students instead of studying all subjects. For instance, In Vietnam, many high schools always encourage their students to choose their favourite field from entering the school to graduating, resulting in a positive classification in the job market.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why students should study their favourite subjects, but in my opinion, studying all subjects will be a crucial foundation in the life of the student after graduation.'",

DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE.' \n 'Text': 'With the increasing human population and demand for more food and residential areas, there has been a sudden increase in deforestration, On the one hand humans are developing more and more concrete buildings resulting in the cutting down of trees, Which will result in the death of many species. This essay will shed some light on what effect logging down the rainforest has on the world and why it should be stopped.\r\n\r\nDeforestation can cause significant issues, such as climate change and the extinction of insects, birds, animals and more living organisms.  A lion, an apex predator, can only survive only if the food chain of that jungle is complete. To cite an example, if we divide forests in India, the tiger reserves, where a tiger survives, have been reduced to an extent because of the lesser number of trees and less area for the predators, which need a larger area to live. A forest report by Jim Corbett National Park suggested that a tiger needs a minimum of 200 KM of jungle area to live.\r\n\r\nThus, Human life is dependent on all other creatures. As we cut more and more trees in the name of development, the effects will be irreversible. However, humans have started plantation campaigns to grow trees and preserve nature. But, it takes a significant amount of time for a plant to grow fully. Furthermore, it is not an over night job to grow a forest thus protecting the nature is very important. To exemplify, A report from the Times of India in 2017 suggested that over  20% of animals and organisms might become extinct at the end of this century.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Destruction of natural resources for human benefits in the short term will create irreversible problems, and thus, I support the fact that deforestation should stop and the world should focus solely on sustainability so that the upcoming generation survives and lives a happy and healthier life.'",

There is a debatable argument between a group of people as they believe subjects like Calculus and Humanities should not be mandatory in learning institutions because they are tough concepts to retain for children. I totally disagree with this statement, In my opinion these courses make  life  easier and benefit in every aspect of life. Let us discuss the views in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n      To commence with, concepts like mathematics and philosophy provide essential skills which result in the foundation of children's intelligence. Moreover, it provides the ability to think in critical situations. Courses like philosophy help to study the moral ethics of an individual in real life. For instance, the children who studied these courses are well known and aware of the fact that where to apply this principle, such as robbery murder, bullying and many more are bad.  They know what makes a good or bad human being. Furthermore, learning calculations could provide numerous benefits as it applies everywhere, so thinking of escaping from numbers in everyday life is impossible.\r\n\r\n    Making all these courses optional, can affect the growth of a child. If they do not learn these concepts they will lack in the problem-solving ability. Not only this, Optional subjects might create disparities in knowledge and skills among students, leading to inequalities in future opportunities. The difficulty of courses can be addressed by adapting teaching methods to make them more accessible and engaging for children. Educational curricula can be designed to gradually introduce complex topics in mathematics and philosophy, making them digestible for offspring of all ages.\r\n\r\n   To Conclude , humanities and calculus are  important courses which cannot be placed into an optional category.

Despite this, it is my contention that renewable energy and biofuels will take oil\u2019s place, as these alternatives have proven to be more beneficial for the environment and local communities. The subsequent sections of this essay will explain this. \r\n\r\nGlobal warming and climate changes worldwide are largely caused by oil, however renewable energy has proven to contribute no harmful chemicals that can damage the environment. For example, David Attenborough conducted a study at National Geographic that indicated that fossil fuels are responsible for 89% of pollution, which causes a disturbance in biodiversity. In addition, renewable energy like solar and wind are also more cost effective and can safe governments money.  Given this, I firmly believe that renewable energy is a more suitable option, as it causes less greenhouse gas emissions.  \r\n\r\nBiofuels are a modem invention that can completely erase the usage of oil. For example, a study at Green Agriculture found that biofuels have the potential to completely replace other energy sources, as they can be produced in almost all regions. Additionally, biofuels consist of various organic matter, which can financially benefit communities and farmers because they are not government owned, like oil. Hence, in my opinion, biofuels have the potential to create more opportunities for humans, which allows them to live in a better economy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, renewable energy and biofuels have the potential to replace oil in the foreseeable future, as I believe they are better for the environment and can benefit local economies.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is ongoing debate regarding the allocation of attention and resources towards the protection of animals and birds. While some argue that too much emphasis is placed on safeguarding wildlife, I recognise the validity of this viewpoint, due to the pressing issues of poverty, lack of clean water, food scarcity, and inadequate healthcare and education in many parts of the world. However, prioritising funding for these necessities should not come at the expense of wildlife conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, proponents of prioritising human-centric issues argue that directing excessive attention and resources towards animal and bird conservation might divert crucial funding away from other pressing human needs. For example, in many regions plagued by poverty and deprivation, basic necessities such as access to clean water, sufficient food, and adequate healthcare and education remain elusive for millions. Redirecting such a vast amount of resources towards addressing these fundamental human rights would potentially alleviate human suffering and improve the overall well-being of communities.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that safeguarding the natural world is an inherent responsibility of humanity. This is because human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and illegal hunting, have significantly depleted both the quality and quantity of the world's wildlife. The rapid decline of various animal and bird species is not merely hypothetical; t is a stark reality that cannot be ignored. Therefore, protecting these species is not only a matter of moral obligation but is also crucial for the sustainability of ecosystems and the survival of future generations.\r\n\r\nIn summarising up, while I agree that addressing human-centric issues should be a priority, I also recognise the importance of wildlife conservation.

As so as they are also a part of that society.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is impossible to build a business not taking into consideration social costs. All activities of companies are made for people as a whole. What is more, corporations are providing their products, services, and facilities for social consumption. Selling them in the market for a high price will not be in demand in the region with a low salary, and common people cannot afford to buy what companies are offering in the market. As a consequence, your business can meet with long-term detriments or even be bankrupt. However, organizing social welfare programs in the frame of big companies will contribute to its sustainable growth.\r\n\r\nNext, protecting the environment should be one of the most important requirements for firms while producing goods, and the government also should set regulations that oblige corporations to environmental accountability. By way of example, factory buildings should be situated far from the living area of inhabitants, to avoid pollution resulting in health problems for the population around.

        "input": "'Question': 'Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?' \n 'Text': 'Currently, in many countries, only a small number of students are opting for science subjects at the university level. I believe there are several reasons behind this phenomenon, which could have significant repercussions for society.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, selecting a scientific discipline as a major necessitates long-term goals and meticulous planning. One major deterrent is the extended duration required to complete these studies, which may result in a lack of sustained financial and emotional support from families. Moreover, the inherent difficulty of science subjects poses a substantial challenge for many students, potentially leading to unsuccessful completion of their degrees. Science unequivocally demands a lively and creative intellect, causing some individuals to abandon their pursuit of it. Additionally, even after graduation, students who majored in science may struggle to find employment due to their lack of experience. This is because certain scientific roles prefer candidates with more practical experience, suggesting that young graduates might not be immediately suitable for science-related jobs.\r\n\r\nThis trend also has profound implications for society. On an individual level, it could exacerbate competition in other academic disciplines, such as business and management, thereby increasing academic pressure and creating a vicious cycle. On a societal level, the declining interest in science subjects diminishes their perceived importance, which is crucial for the development of society, including advancements in technology and space exploration. This decline could hinder the progress of societal technology.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the decision to study science at the university level is fraught with challenges, including the rigorous academic requirements and the need for a long-term commitment. These challenges contribute to the insufficient number of students pursuing science, which could have lasting negative effects on both individual career prospects and the broader societal advancement.'",

While some advocate for stoically enduring adversity, others argue for proactive measures to enhance one's situation. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints and offer my opinion on this matter.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, proponents of acceptance argue that there are situations in life that are beyond our control, and attempting to change them may only lead to frustration and disappointment. Accepting a less-than-ideal job or financial constraints can foster a sense of contentment and gratitude for what one has, rather than constantly striving for more. Moreover, accepting adversity can cultivate resilience and inner strength, as individuals learn to adapt and find fulfillment despite challenging circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, advocates for improvement contend that complacency in the face of adversity stifles personal growth and perpetuates inequality and injustice. Striving for improvement enables individuals to challenge the status quo, break free from cycles of poverty or dissatisfaction, and pursue opportunities for self-fulfillment and success. Moreover, by actively seeking to improve their situations, individuals can contribute to positive societal change and create a better future for themselves and others.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while acceptance has its merits in fostering resilience and inner peace, it should not preclude efforts to improve one's circumstances. While there are situations beyond our control, there are also many aspects of our lives that we have the power to change through determination, perseverance, and resourcefulness. By adopting a mindset of acceptance while simultaneously striving for improvement, individuals can strike a balance between contentment and ambition, finding fulfillment in both the present moment and future aspirations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate between accepting adverse circumstances and seeking improvement reflects fundamental questions about human nature and agency. While acceptance can promote resilience and inner peace, striving for improvement empowers individuals to challenge the status quo and create positive change in their lives and society. Ultimately, embracing both acceptance and improvement can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling approach to navigating life's challenges.'",

Some people claim that e-books are bound to oust conventional ones, while others believe that traditional printed books will never be a thing of the past. Discuss both views and express your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The rise of e-books in recent years has sparked a contentious debate about the future of the publishing industry. While some argue that e-books will eventually replace traditional printed books, others contend that printed books will always hold a cherished place in society. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide my opinion on this matter.\r\n\r\nProponents of e-books argue that digital technology offers numerous advantages over printed books. Firstly, e-books are convenient and portable, allowing readers to carry an entire library in a single device. With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and e-readers, readers can access their favorite books anytime, anywhere, without the need for physical storage space. Additionally, e-books often provide features such as adjustable font sizes, search functionality, and hyperlinks, enhancing the reading experience and accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, e-books are environmentally friendly, as they eliminate the need for paper production and transportation, thereby reducing carbon emissions and deforestation. From a cost perspective, e-books are often more affordable than their printed counterparts, making reading more accessible to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nHowever, advocates for printed books argue that they offer unique sensory experiences and emotional connections that e-books cannot replicate. The tactile sensation of turning pages, the smell of ink on paper, and the aesthetic pleasure of a beautifully bound book contribute to the overall reading experience. Moreover, printed books evoke nostalgia and cultural significance, serving as tangible artifacts of human history and creativity.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while e-books offer undeniable convenience and environmental benefits, printed books will never be entirely replaced. The tactile and emotional aspects of reading from a physical book hold enduring appeal for many readers, myself included. Rather than viewing e-books and printed books as competitors, I believe they can coexist harmoniously, each serving different preferences and purposes in the diverse landscape of literature.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate over the future of books underscores the dynamic interplay between technology and tradition. While e-books offer undeniable advantages in terms of convenience and accessibility, printed books continue to hold a special place in the hearts of readers worldwide. Ultimately, the choice between e-books and printed books boils down to personal preference, and both formats contribute to the rich tapestry of human storytelling and knowledge dissemination.'",

That is a rise from around 28% of the global population being online to almost 65%.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is a positive or a negative development?' \n 'Text': 'In the past decade, the proliferation of internet usage worldwide has been nothing short of remarkable, skyrocketing from under two billion users in 2010 to over five billion today. This surge translates to an increase from approximately 28% to nearly 65% of the global population being connected to the online realm. While some may argue that this exponential growth harbors negative implications, it is my firm contention that the expansion of internet access signifies an overwhelmingly positive development for humanity.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the widespread adoption of the internet fosters unparalleled connectivity, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries. Individuals from diverse backgrounds can now effortlessly communicate, collaborate, and exchange ideas in real-time, thereby enriching cross-cultural understanding and global cooperation. This interconnectedness has facilitated the dissemination of knowledge and information, empowering people with educational resources, online courses, and platforms for self-improvement regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the internet serves as a catalyst for economic empowerment and entrepreneurship, particularly in developing regions. By bridging the gap between producers and consumers through e-commerce platforms, aspiring entrepreneurs can establish businesses with minimal capital, tapping into a global market and creating job opportunities within their communities. This democratization of commerce not only stimulates economic growth but also fosters innovation and creativity, driving sustainable development and poverty alleviation efforts worldwide.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the internet democratizes access to information, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability within societies. Social media platforms and online news outlets provide a platform for citizens to voice their concerns, hold governments and institutions accountable, and advocate for social justice and human rights. This newfound transparency cultivates democratic values, fosters civic engagement, and facilitates the exchange of diverse perspectives, ultimately strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the exponential growth of internet usage represents a transformative force for good, facilitating global connectivity, economic empowerment, and societal progress. While challenges such as digital inequality and online misinformation persist, the overall impact of internet proliferation on humanity is undeniably positive, heralding a more interconnected, informed, and empowered global community.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.' \n 'Text': 'In today's digital age, the debate between the merits of reading and watching television persists. While some argue that both mediums offer avenues for entertainment and learning, I contend that reading significantly surpasses television in enhancing language skills and nurturing creativity. This essay will delineate the manifold reasons supporting this viewpoint.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, reading fosters a deeper engagement with language compared to watching television. When individuals read, they actively decode words, sentences, and paragraphs, thereby reinforcing their comprehension and language acquisition skills. Unlike television, which often provides passive entertainment, reading necessitates mental effort and critical thinking. For instance, readers must infer meanings from context, analyze character motivations, and visualize settings, all of which contribute to linguistic proficiency. Research by cognitive psychologists such as Keith Rayner supports this assertion, demonstrating that reading facilitates vocabulary expansion and syntactic development more effectively than passive activities like television viewing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, reading offers a boundless landscape for imagination and creativity to flourish. Through literature, individuals encounter diverse perspectives, cultures, and scenarios that stimulate their cognitive faculties. Unlike the visual constraints of television, where narratives are presented in a predefined manner, reading encourages readers to co-create worlds within their minds. This imaginative process not only enriches one's inner life but also nurtures creativity by encouraging divergent thinking and problem-solving skills. Studies conducted by scholars like Dr. Keith Oatley elucidate how fiction reading correlates with heightened empathy and creativity, underscoring the profound impact of literary engagement on cognitive development.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, reading cultivates a nuanced understanding of language nuances and literary devices, which are essential for effective communication and expression. By immersing oneself in a variety of genres and styles, readers absorb linguistic patterns, rhetorical techniques, and narrative structures that enrich their own writing and communication skills. In contrast, television, with its reliance on visual and auditory stimuli, often neglects the intricacies of language and relies more on spectacle than substance. As a result, individuals who prioritize reading over television are better equipped to articulate their thoughts, convey complex ideas, and engage in meaningful discourse.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the assertion that reading enhances language skills and creativity while television does little for these abilities is firmly supported by empirical evidence and logical reasoning. Reading not only deepens linguistic proficiency but also stimulates imagination, fosters creativity, and hones communication skills. As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the enduring value of reading as a catalyst for personal growth and intellectual development cannot be overstated. Therefore, individuals seeking to enhance their language skills and creativity would be wise to prioritize reading as an indispensable tool for self-improvement and enrichment.'",

What are the causes and solutions?' \n 'Text': 'The issue of fresh water is growing rapidly around the globe for the time being. From my perspective, the most contributing factors to this problem are the pollution of water along with wasting clean water to fruitless things and banning throwing  rubbish into the water sources together with saving pure water can be considered as viable solutions to it. \r\n\r\n       Chief among the causes of this problem is contamination of H2O. For instance, If individuals throw trash into lakes , they will not be able to drink soft water. Accordingly, people are throwing a large amounts  of garbage into rivers, Which can be harmful to the environment. Another important reason for this  is the usage of water for useless activities such as running the aqua for a long time. The prime example of this, some youngsters just open the tap for no reason. \r\n\r\n     In order to resolve this issue I deem that its root causes should be first addressed. Perhaps the most effective method of doing this would be, not allowing humans to throw the rubbish to banned areas. In this case, the government should give severe punishments to law offenders, however this shall ease the situation. One further measure can be preserving the water. As an example, If people save water there will be enough water for every person.\r\n\r\n     By way of conclusion, I reckon that fresh water is  clearly a problem of such complexity that no solution is likely in the short term. Nonetheless, I believe that restricting   garbage to specific zones and the economy of uncontaminated water would constitute a very good first step.'",

What steps could be taken to reduced them?' \n 'Text': 't is generally believed that cities often have better living standards than countryside; however, the trend itself creates issues. This essay will discuss the causes of it and provide possible solutions.\r\n\r\nThe disparity in living standards between cities and the countryside can be attributed to factors such as differences in public infrastructure and job opportunities. Rural areas often lack essential facilities like hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. Additionally, the limited job opportunities in the countryside results in the migration of young people to cities, leaving the elderly population behind. This creates a vicious cycle of dependency on the elderly population for support, as well as making cities overcrowded.\r\n\r\nImproving the availability and accessibility of transportation is essential in reducing the gap in living standards between urban and rural areas. When transportation is convenient for individuals and businesses, the disparity in living standards is likely to diminish. For business, the cost of operating a business in the countryside is typically lower than in urban areas. Additionally, owing to efficiency of transportation, there is no need to afraid of losing connection to the city. At the same time, improving access to transportation increases the likelihood of individuals choosing to reside in cheaper countryside areas due to easier access to the city. With adequate transportation options, the decision between city and countryside living may not be a significant concern, thus helping to alleviate the issue.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the variation in living standards between cities and the countryside is largely due to differences in infrastructure and job opportunities, improvements in transportation by the government could lead to a progressive reduction in the gap.'",

To what extend do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'While some people opine that having at least a month vacation a year for employees will negatively impact their work quality, I would argue that this is crucial for workers and gives them a chance to take a rest and become full of energy and enthusiasm in further activities. In this essay, I plan to highlight my point of view and substantiate it with examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, a long vacation is not convenient for employers due to the financial burden on the company budget. Obviously, this becomes more significant if the company has a huge number of employees. Additionally, a long interruption in the employment process is not the best thing that could happen as staff members feel a kind of strain the first time right after vacation until they will completely be involved in the labour routine. For example, it happened to me when after the New Year holiday I had a sense of confusion and even forgot tasks that were my everyday responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, if a person works continuously without a break, he could feel depressed and tired. I am convinced that for a complete recharging a month's break is the best duration. To elaborate, if a week is given as a leave, an individual will be forced to do everything in a hurry, and I am not sure it is a true way to relax. Moreover, if a person feels sick, he will spend a whole vacation at home getting better. For instance, last year I experienced such a situation when I had a fever, and this was a reason for me to realize that a week is too short for taking a rest.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, taking into consideration all the abovementioned, I would like to sum up that although there is an opinion that a month is a quite long period for leaving a workplace, I still believe that a shorter time period does not always match to employee's expectations.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places.' \n 'Text': 'Currently, there is a high demand for professionals in capital cities worldwide owing to the development of big companies. For this reason, many people believe that living in an urban area is more convenient for reaching academic and professional goals, while many others still argue the importance of developing skills by raising their children in rural areas. In this essay, I am explaining why each of them has either advantages or drawbacks related to upbringing.  \r\n\r\nTo start with, it is well-known that urban life has more appropriate conditions for studying, not only about basic infrastructural requirements but also about technological tools and educators with high-teaching skills. For example, in Colombia, there are many schools with luxury installations such as classrooms with cutting-edge computers and tablets in order to improve the quality of learning. Besides, tutors must certify at least one postgraduate degree in education and pedagogy. However, metropolitans have higher rate of competitiveness and stressful life, then these could be some triggers of mental issues such as anxiety or depression with an increase in suicide data. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, countryside life is more peaceful and its environments have less pollution. Then, standard skills about crops and harvesting could be taught by parents by inculcating an inherited pattern from generation to generation because families want their landscapes to be cared for by their offsprings.  Nonetheless, rural areas have been uncovered by some governments, then they do not guarantee a high quality of education among those. For example, in Latin America, most populations that live on the outskirts have to walk for more than one hour to school.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, either cities or countryside have merit and demerit to live in. Hence, parents should consider all points of view thoroughly, and try to teach their children both types of lifestyles in order to open their minds and cultures.'",

This essay will discuss both the Positives and drawbacks of compulsory rules for wearing uniforms. In my opinion, advantages are more than the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a uniform is an Identity for both the school and the students. It helps to create bonding between all the students. Consequently, this leads to brotherhood among students from different classes. Moreover, uniforms are essential because of their power to break  social classifications. For example, uniforms can ensure the same dress for the children from both the rich and poor students. This is a part of a lesson that can be useful for the students in their future life also. Finally, it is pleasant to see the beauty of a school, when all the students wear the same dress.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there exist some drawbacks, Firstly, students may lose their comfort because of wearing the same dress every day. Sometimes schools select such a type of dress, which is designed with many add-on parts especially on the Shoulder, such kind of dress is not at all easy to wear for a teenager.

I personally believe that the negative points of using plastic are more than the advantages of that.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, certainly one of the advantages of using plastic containers might be the expenses of them. Simply put, plastics and the process of producing them are often cheaper than other products. For instance, some food and drink companies have mentioned that while the utilization of plastic containers might pose significant costs, in comparison to other materials, it is often a more cost-effective option. Moreover, another factor which is considerable is the weight of the plastic containers. Plastics are usually lighter than other materials like glasses, so companies find it easier to transport their products. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the drawbacks of the increases in usage of plastics are by no means negligible, the prime concern is the difficult process of recycling plastics. Although, various types of plastics are recyclable , the procedure Is often expensive and not available for all kinds of them. A good illustration might be that due to those problems, recycling companies would rather  manage waste disposal instead of recycling them.

In my perspective, I strongly agree with both statements because two ways can lead the students to a positive result.\r\n\r\nFor the people who want to learn more subjects in their program. The most reasonable reason is that they have a consistent basement in their main major. For that reason, learning and signing more subjects can help college students obtain new knowledge and bring new experiences for them in their learning process. Moreover, studying more subjects also helps pupils develop themself and makes them more confident to encounter  new challenges in the future. In addition, It also supports and brings  students more and more opportunities jobs for  after graduation. For example, students after university can easily apply for reputation companies if they have more qualifications in their time of college.\r\n\r\nFor students who believe that is essential to focus and spend all time in one major. That is also a good way to grow  with a strong foundation of knowledge. For example, paying  attention to their main subjects can help them separate their time from other activities such as sports, research and entertainment more effectively. Sometimes, having a busy schedule with many subjects is not a productive way to obtain new things and gain experience. In addition, most well-known companies and corporations such as Apple, Google or Riot require a huge amount of employees who have  wide expertise for their main in university. Because the percentage of finding jobs increases day by day and there are fewer  positions for employees than before. So, having a perfect qualification in one major can also be a potential priority for the young generation in their career occupation in the future. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, learning more subjects with the main major or concentrating more on the main subjects are both  reasonable ways to gain  success in the academic path.

If yes, what are the ways and means you suggestfor this?' \n 'Text': 'Wildlife is crucial for human survival and the biosphere. By keeping the current socioeconomic status in mind. I firmly believe that wildlife should be protected,regardless,of time as it is helpful in maintaining ecosystems  and insect populations.There are a multitude of factors through which it can be done which I will discuss in my further essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, wildlife plays an imperative role in maintaining ecological balance, pollination of crops and preventing the spread of diseases. If wildlife extinction continues, humans may face an ecological crisis. Therefore, there is a significant need to address this predicament and it can be achieved by a plethora of factors. The predominant one is habitat conservation. To elaborate further, conserving natural habitats, such as wetlands and woods, entails protecting land from development and human activities that can disturb the ecology. Subsequently,it can be done by reforestation, aforestation and wetland restoration. It not only helps in protecting the species but also aids in revitalising biodiversity. The nature-based projects provide their assistance in this gravest matter. For instance; Bulindi Chimpanzee Habitat Restoration Project. This project restores the rapidly declining chimpanzee habitat of over 300 chimpanzees in Uganda.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, another worth mentioning method is to adopt sustainable land use practices. This can include promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing the use of pesticides and other obnoxious chemicals, and using eco-friendly technology in forestry and other industries. Besides this, it also involves reducing the impact of human activities,such as poaching and deforestation .In addition to this, public education and awareness also play a fundamental role in protecting.In order to educate the people about wildlife conservation outreach school programmes and public awareness campaigns ought to be organized.By generating awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation it may create a culture of responsible and sustainable behaviour.Along with this, through learning about different species and their unique characteristics, people can develop a great understanding of the natural world that will create a sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite having socioeconomic issues, wildlife preservation is mandatory because it contributes to maintaining the balance of life on earth.Through various factors and methods,wildlife can be conserved.'",

I agree with this view. Although it isn\u2019t easy to measure someone\u2019s value to society, I personally feel that scientists and technology experts have a more significant impact not only on our society\u2019s economy, but also on essential services that improve our quality of life.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, science, technology, and the arts are all very productive industries. However, while there is a shortage of scientists and technicians, there tend to be fewer jobs available for creative workers. As a result, creative people often spend more time unemployed, in temporary, low-skilled jobs, or working on eccentric projects that would need to generate more income. Consequently, they contribute less to society financially. An example of this is a study conducted in the United States which revealed that approximately 64% of individuals with a degree in the arts end up working in fields unrelated to their artistic expertise.\r\n\r\nSecondly, although art and music are often greatly respected and appreciated, it is possible to survive without them. On the other hand, science and technology are necessary to provide power, water, medicine, communications, food and much more. Therefore, we could argue that experts in these fields are far more valuable. For instance, in times of crisis or natural disasters, it is scientific advancements that prove critical in saving lives and rebuilding communities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe scientists and technology experts contribute significantly more to society than artists. They have more job opportunities and play a vital part in fields like healthcare, infrastructure, and innovation. While art and music hold great cultural value, the role of science and technology in providing essential services and improving lives makes them more valuable contributors to society overall.'",

Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Online or distance learning using the internet has become popular on some campuses and schools, leading to a debate between the benefits and drawbacks of this trend. While the effectiveness of distance and time can be appealing, there are significant concerns regarding their impact on students' mental states.\r\n\r\nAs for the benefits, it might be argued that with the increased time-effectiveness come the opportunities that online learning offers. In this world of technology, it is not surprising that many people choose online learning as an option. In addition, distance learning can save students's money in the form of transportation. For example, students who attend classes using the Zoom app and do not need to spend the effort to physically go to class save half the money.\r\n\r\nFirst, it negatively impacts the quality of student learning due to the lack of face-to-face interaction and direct feedback from a teacher. Secondly, it can lead to a feeling of isolation and a lack of community as students miss out on the social aspect of campus life. Lastly, distance learning requires high self-motivation and discipline, which may be a challenge for some students. For example, in a viral video on TikTok during the rise of COVID and distance learning, a student who was in class just turned on the zoom and closed the camera and then did other activities without paying attention to the teacher.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I would argue that this lack of measurability of trends related to learning quality can be a substantial drawback. Thus, this outweighs its potential benefits.'",

Do you agree?' \n 'Text': 'In recent decades, the climate of our planet has undergone significant changes. With the impact of global pollution, the question of whether the government has effective measures to address this problem has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts consider the government have been sluggish in implementing relevant political action. From my perspective, I agree with this opinion.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why policy initiatives to deal with climate change have been inadequate.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that consumer culture and overconsumption have led to a significant increase in carbon emissions and environmental degradation.Despite the growing awareness of the need for sustainable living, political leaders have failed to enact policies that promote responsible consumption patterns and discourage wasteful practices.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, empirical studies have shown that pollution particularly from industrial activities continues to exacerbate the impacts of climate change.Even though numerous international agreements and initiatives aimed at reducing emissions and curbing pollution,progress has been slow due to political inertia and the influence of vested interests.Therefore, there is often a gap between public opinion and political action. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the recognition of climate change as a threat to the planet is widespread, political action to address the root causes of excessive consumerism and pollution remains inadequate. To effectively combat climate change, governments must demonstrate stronger leadership and commitment to implementing policies that promote sustainable development and reduce environmental degradation. Only through collective action and international cooperation can we hope to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is a school of thought that social media platforms exert significant adverse effects on both individuals and society. From my perspective, I agree with this opinion to some extent.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, social networking sites undeniably offer numerous advantages to individuals, fostering a broader sense of community. Firstly, they serve as a conduit for continuous updates on global affairs, including political developments and financial trends. Moreover, they facilitate maintaining familial connections and even fostering new relationships. Lastly, they serve as invaluable platforms for expanding one's knowledge and skills through the sharing of useful information and access to free educational resources, thereby enhancing career prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, the flip side of the coin reveals that social media platforms can harbor substantial detrimental consequences for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, the ubiquitous dissemination of information on these platforms often blurs the line between truth and falsehood, leading individuals to engage with misleading or fabricated content. Furthermore, the ease of connectivity can expose users to various risks, such as falling victim to scams or unwittingly engaging in illegal activities. Notably, the pervasive phenomenon of peer pressure among the younger demographic can be directly attributed to the influence of social media platforms. Alarmingly, recent reports indicate a significant surge in mental health issues among young people, with the prevalence more than doubling over the past decade.\r\n\r\nWith all of the aforementioned theses and explanations, the conclusion is self-evident.

All of us had unreached dreams during our educational periods. We pass those days, but those wishes remain in our brains, so when we face a similar situation again as parents, we try to do all we can to help our children get those wishes. The point is that we never think that our dreams and our children's dreams are the same.

Discuss and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There is quite an obvious discussion around the topic of shopping. While some people believe that mega-stores are unnecessary for people who want to buy any goods for them, I would argue that this trend has more benefits and comfortable for consumers. I will explain my reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that most supermarkets provide all goods and well-designed layouts. This is because the most part of the goods are located in the appropriate department, which can make it convenient for customers to find a product. For example, in Australia, Coles supermarket can provide all goods such as dairy-free, gluten-free and nut-free in each department that can be easy to find from buyers. As a result, that can make all customers less spend time on their shopping while they have to go to work or have to look after their kids.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that mega-stores are necessary for buyers who would like to buy a greater number of products. This is based on the fact that shopping in a big supermarket that can also have offer a special price to buy all products. For instance, Costco Wholesale can provide the price of their goods with a decent price while their membership customers buy a large amount of products at that time. Consequently, many supermarkets offer special a discount system by encouraging people with membership cards.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can observe that shopping in a big supermarket has a lot of benefits for consumers that can be a convenient location for goods and decent prices.

How can people research this?' \n 'Text': 'Being a homeowner has always been at the top of the list of a person's important life ambitions, especially in today's world where getting a place to live requires a lot of labour. Hence, the history of a home or an apartment is among the concerns that many people often tend to investigate. Hence, in this essay, I will provide several reasons why they do that with a number of methods that assist them in finding out the information.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, when it comes to the purpose of this behaviour, it can be attributed to various reasons, and individuals can undertake research to uncover the ancient background of their houses or buildings. Having deeper insight into the state of the area you will shortly occupy could give you useful information for future renovations or replacements as well as give you more leverage in negotiations with the previous owner of the property. To paraphrase, those who intend to sell a house learn about the past of the property to appraise it. In fact, homes with significant historical value will cost more than typical ones.\r\n\r\nLearning about the history of one's house or building may contribute to a sense of personal identity, as individuals uncover the stories and events associated with their homes, potentially linking them to their own family history and their ancestors. However, as for the people who are spiritual, knowing about the house's past is a means of warding off negative energies by worshipping, for example. Lastly, we just inherit curiosity\u2014along with other survival traits\u2014that have long been a part of our ancestors' lineage. In brief, people have a desire to find out about their home's origins for a variety of reasons, depending on the circumstances and goals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with regard to the approach people choose to discover the information of their accommodation, it\u2019s quite hard and difficult to filter the right ones. For starters, a throughout discussion with a real estate agent or a past owner of the property would be fair enough. If possible, one of the sources that we can easily take advantage of is word of mouth, or it may come from rumour. In other words, to gain understanding, individuals frequently interact with locals who have lived in the region for a long time or with the elderly, but this is hard to verify. What\u2019s more, another way is that they may use resources in local libraries and historical societies to explore documents, images, and detailed histories related to specific areas and properties. Last but not least, if the mentioned residence is a well-known place, the Internet is the best way to help the owner collect data. Last but not least, the local government's database contains everything you need to know about the details of the house as well.  Therefore, there are various methods that people can apply when they need to gain a comprehensive understanding of the history as well as the development of the property.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why the public is becoming more intrigued in discovering the historical significance of their home or structure, and they can conduct in-depth studies by utilizing a variety of archival, community, internet, and academic resources. Obviously, finding the right approaches is vital for us if we need to save time and money.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The standard office schedule typically spans 8 hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., across 5 consecutive days, leading to widespread employee fatigue. To combat this, there's a proposal recommending that employers grant at least four weeks of annual leave to enhance workplace performance. This essay supports the proposal that offering at least four weeks of annual leave could significantly boost work outcomes.\r\n\r\n Humans differ from machines in their need for downtime; relentless annual labour diminishes our efficiency. This effect is especially pronounced in repetitive jobs, where the absence of breaks can degrade performance. Ample evidence has demonstrated that prolonged workdays, especially in roles that interact directly with customers or involve healthcare aggravates the ambient.  Employees may provide subpar service and even exhibit unpleasant facial expressions, failing to meet the visitors' expectations leading to tarnishing the company's reputation. Thus, breaks are essential for rejuvenation and energy replenishment. \r\n\r\nImagining a scenario where staff work every single day without rest highlights the chaos and potential for adverse customer experiences. This realisation bolsters the argument for mandatory four-week vacations, allowing employees time for relaxation, personal pursuits, and a return to work with renewed enthusiasm. \r\n\r\n Ultimately, given the considerable hours dedicated to work, ensuring employees have sufficient time off is critical for maintaining balance and preventing burnout. The entitlement to a month's holiday annually supports a healthy work-life balance and upholds the principle that well-rested employees are more productive and engaged, carrying a rewarding impact for both the company and the worker.'",

While watching sports may offer insights, I personally believe that actively engaging in sports is more beneficial for developing these skills. \r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why watching sports can foster teamwork and strategy in individuals. Firstly, many people are passionate about sports, making it an accessible and effective means to acquire these skills. For example, football lovers can learn from their favorite team\u2019s strategies and observe how well the players collaborate with their teammates to win the match. Secondly, by only observing team sports individuals can focus more deeply on achieving necessary teamwork and strategy skills as it is less stressful compared to actively playing sports for the purpose of winning. Finally, watching sports can offer valuable insights into strategy and teamwork. Individuals can analyze successful teams' tactics and observe player interactions, applying them to their own understanding of these features.\r\n\r\nDespite the above arguments, it seems to me that playing sports can be a more practical rout to instill teamwork and strategy abilities in an individual. By participating in team sports, people can analyze and internalize these skills. For instance, in a basketball game, players must communicate effectively, coordinate their movements, and adapt their strategies based on the actions of their opponents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I believe that active participation in sports offers experiential learning, fostering a deeper understanding of teamwork and strategy compared to passive observation.'",

While some individuals are skeptical about the abovementioned approach, this essay will highlight several reasons why the benefits outweigh the negative sides. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, sporting sponsorships certainly bring about some disadvantages. First, one of the most straightforward approaches for sponsoring is to advertise on sporting events' live broadcasts. However, brands might struggle subsequently due to the high cost of this marketing tool. For example, companies are shelling out roughly $7 million for 30 seconds of ad time on the Super Bowl. With that being said, not every brand receives high turnover from this practice, especially with controversial commercials that will spark public outrage. Secondly, brands that sponsor certain teams or prominent athletes can face backlash when scandals occur. Companies\u2019 brand images will directly be affected which requires intensive and lengthy public relations management. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this practice is still favored by most international brands for its merits. First, for some sporting events, sponsorships are crucial for the organizing and operating process. The Olympics is one of many events that receive funds from footwear brands like Nike to beverage brands, such as Coca Cola to assist athletes and efficiently develop more sports worldwide. Furthermore, sponsoring sporting events also means boosting brand awareness on a mass scale, reaching various age ranges and new potential customers. Eventually, this results in higher sales that in the long run, will compensate or even exceed the previous vast sum of money for advertisement.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, while sponsoring sports still has room for discussion, I am of the opinion that collaboration between sports and corporations could offer higher mutual benefits for each other, as one receives financial aid for operations and one earns reputational advantages and a rise in sales.'",

I believe that advertisement is the strongest method of marketing. While these promotional contents can be deleted if they are not appealing. This essay will discuss both sides, along with my viewpoint. \r\n\r\nAdvertisement is the main tool that has persuaded us to buy something. This is because most people strongly believe something that they hear or watch visually. Therefore, advertisements are still being significant method to sell products or services, hence, types and methods of marketing are changing day by day according to  social development. For example, livestreaming is  popular  these days on social media and marketers often use it for their business on a daily basis. Consequently, there are many marketing tools, advertisement is the strongest one to persuade users. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, according to technological advancement, people are able to choose what they watch or do not. This advancement offers the choice whether to watch or see advertisements or not. For example, it is possible to ignore some unnecessary marketing content by clicking a simple button. Therefore, some people usually do not care about promotional content while watching TV or social media channels. The majority of people are only interested in promotional content if they feel useful . \r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my opinion, advertisements are still  one of the useful methods of sales because of the fact that people are persuaded by them.

From an educational standpoint, all people  should benefit from equal conditions for academic studies and this opportunity can be given by holding an entrance exam.

They insist that the government should not bear the cost of students' education. However, I do not find this argument convincing as students have no duty to fund universities.

I strongly support the first perspective since happiness is considered one of the other feelings and people have the ability to control their feelings.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand,based on much scientific research, the brain secretes some hormones responsible for feeling happiness. To illustrate, one of these hormones is called endorphins, which the brain secretes after exercise.

It is obvious that people are mainly responsible for choosing to have a good life and be happy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,others believe that happiness is always linked to several factors in life. For example, people who agree that happiness depends on money, such as the common concept that travel always brings happiness.\r\n\r\nBoth views have valid points; however, I firmly agree that everyone can control their feelings and opt to be happy or not, and that does not depend on any factors such as money or travel because it is temporary. Since many people might have a lot of money, they are not happy.

Machines will get rid of some processes, and from that cost for each stage will be declined. Although people are worried about the replacement, however, it creates more job opportunities due to it need for an operator to make it work.

This phenomenon leads to positives in decreasing the burden on people which can improve  society.\r\n\r\nRobots and artificial intelligence now are familiar to society as they are strong and robust. Those machines was made from metal that is tough and strong ingredients can cope well with the high and tough working environments. Moreover, those machines can automatically generate actions based on a simple request, without any help. Consequently, robots are potential tools for some jobs requiring strength and tolerance skills to avoid job accidents in humans. For instance, robots are now used in construction sites where they are used to carry heavy packages or work at  high altitudes. \r\n\r\nThose robots have improved the public's status by preventing employees from suffering stress in the workplace. These devices not only  do heavy jobs but also check the mistakes in documents in offices. Using its search program, artificial intelligence applications are applied to office workers with new ideas or develop  plans for their products. In this way, workplace is not a stressful place, forcing employees to generate new ideas and also the products are completely perfect when publicizing them. Moreover, reducing stress also helps the public have a better experience in their mental health and their social life. Therefore, robotic achievements are the best tool for people, especially in this era when everyone can easily suffer from depression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, automatic automobiles and synthesis intelligence are replacing humans due to their superior ability that bring benefits to a country. Furthermore, this alternative may result in lower depression in people.'",

It is the writer of this essay who contends that this is a negative influence in the near future due to the significant changes in the number of jobless people in all fields.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of negative impacts when intelligent retrieval develops. Firstly, artificial intelligence will cause an increase in unemployment in the near future. This is particularly the case for manual workers who will be replaced by AI robots because robots can do manual jobs precisely in a short time, such as delivery men or cashiers in supermarkets. Secondly, people can leak private information because they use smart devices that are based on expert systems. This is because users have to sign up with their real information to use some platforms, and this makes hackers and cybercriminals able to steal personal information through the Internet. For example, according to some surveys, thirty percent of Facebook users in 2019 admitted that their accounts were stolen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever, in my view, the development of the artificial intelligence field has greater positive impacts on people's lives. Primarily, artificial intelligence will help boost productivity in companies. In fact, officers can save much time solving paper work. Moreover, people's lives will become more convenient and smarter with the Internet, which is based on knowledge engineering technology. For example, with a smart home system, people can turn on or turn off the light with their voice, and this system can even send an alarm from home to the owners.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the growth of neutral networks has some negative impacts on human lives, I believe that the artificial intelligence field brings better effects on lives, such as working and quality of life.'",

However, our society will face detrimental effects if humans depend too much on technological devices.                              \r\n\r\nOne of the core reasons why artificial intelligence become the norm in industries has to do with how it can help people make work easier in terms of time-saving. Due to the fact that machines can take care of the bulk of work, thus, giving individuals more time to complete more tasks. Take hospitals in Japan as a good example, where technology prepares prescriptions automatically so that the doctors will have enough time to get equipment ready for surgery. Therefore, the process will be made in a more productive way.\r\n\r\nIt should also be recognized that this tendency may lead to negative consequences in terms of work life. The proliferation of automation will make people easily lose their jobs as machinery can do the work of a person. In addition, with robots, many steps have been automated . As a result, the yields are boosted, which means there will be a downsizing in many factories because robots can gain an edge over humans . As a consequence, the rate of unemployment will increase significantly due to the development of technology.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, high-tech devices play an important role in the work environment, which help to fulfil human duties. By contrast, industries which rely too much on that kind of machines will easily cause a decrease in labour force.'",

This writer contends that success attained through effort and hard work holds greater value than that based solely on appearance or wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that individuals who are determined and hardworking can generate wealth and enhance their physical appearance through their abilities. Such individuals can quickly amass wealth because they possess the drive necessary to make money, a fundamental requirement for achieving financial success. Additionally, focusing on improving one's appearance is relatively straightforward in today's world.\r\n\r\nHowever, critics argue that wealth and appearance are vital in advancing quickly in certain professions. They assert that a prerequisite for career advancement is a favorable appearance and financial stability, as people often respond positively to attractive and affluent individuals. Furthermore, certain occupations, such as flight attendants, receptionists, and customer service representatives, prioritize hiring attractive employees. Therefore, financial status and appearance are deemed crucial in the workforce.\r\n\r\nWhile this perspective has merit, diligent and determined workers can demonstrate their value and excel in their careers. It is evident that such individuals are likely to leverage their skills and experiences to make a positive impact in their work. By consistently delivering high-quality work, they can create favorable impressions and cultivate opportunities for professional growth and advancement. Consequently, academically inclined and hardworking individuals possess the capabilities to compete with their wealthier and more physically appealing counterparts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while wealth and appearance may facilitate job promotions and align with certain job requirements, educated and determined workers possess the ability and resilience necessary to achieve success.'",

Moreover, elders usually need some particular help from other people, especially from their children. So , if they are living alone, they are not getting pleasant care from their child.

Also, having a stable monetary situation is one of the key elements for college students when they have part-time jobs . Firstly, Some college students are hired as  junior employees to work for some specific companies free of charge where they can be faced with real problems.

Hence, they prefer to buy a lot of toys for their kids so that they do not feel bored in their absence.  Furthermore, there are some toys available in the market that can help teenagers in academics as well because all kids are not excellent in studies as they lack concentration as well as confidence. Likewise, parents can buy the Atlas game for their offspring to improve their Geography, this will assist them to alleviate their stress to some extent. Moreover, such educational tools can help them to score better on their exams.\r\n\r\nHowever, purchasing enormous toys has pernicious effects on the relations between guardians and their kids. This leads to the augment in generation gap between them. Because child might feel more connected to the soft toys rather than their caretakers. Furthermore, juveniles who have a relentless number of gaming equipment might end up cutting their relationship with their friends as well. The reason behind this is that they will probably prefer to spend time alone rather than playing outside with their buddies. The repercussions of this are disruptive because it will be the reason behind lack of the confidence in some youngsters along with this, their physical growth might also suffer. Therefore, it is apparent why many do not prefer to buy a lot of toys for their children.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the purchase of toys by guardians for their kids has both positive and negative effects on the kids. I think buying toys could be beneficial for busy parents if they will also spend time with them, it will help to blur the line of generation gap in society and they can primarily buy the types of equipment that should be used outside to play with friends to boost their morale, confidence, and their physical growth.'",

Moreover, the governments should encourage their residents to work by giving them extra revenue and a place to live until they receive their private homes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, increasing unemployment and poverty rates in certain countries where homelessness is rising are the major causes underlying this issue. To handle this problem, governments should improve their citizens\u2019 financial condition by imposing regulations.'",

Some people think that it should be not allowed, meanwhile others believe that is not a problem. In this essay, l will give points for two sides and my own point of view.\r\n\r\nUsing mobile phones to call should be banned because of several reasons. To begin with, the main claim of people who are against a telephone conversation in a crowded place is that it annoys and disrupts people's peace. For example, when a big family comes to the park to spend time together, and someone loudly talks on a mobile phone,  it annoys people, who come to the park for  family enjoyment and relaxation or when people are in a caf\u00e9, it is very hard to be concentrated on food, while somebody there has a loud dialogue through the phone.\r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly believe that Individuals should not be limited by where they may use smartphones to call. This is because our modern society, mainly builds around the idea of materialism. Therefore, having access to calls everywhere to anyone is a fundamental thing today. If people will not be allowed to call in public places, it can bring tremendous drawbacks for some people. For instance, an employee of the shop forgot to return the keys to the boss, and he turned off his phone because he was at the restaurant, while his boss was trying to find him. Simultaneously, this shop missed thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, everywhere telephone should be allowed to be used, and it is the anger of surroundings or something else, it will cost much more lower in comparison with one, but very important missed call.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?' \n 'Text': 'Tons of people are using distance-learning programs while studying at home. While some of them tend to believe that it does not have the same advantages as attending college or university in person, Personally, I strongly agree and prefer to use learning methods, especially when I am at a distance, as they are more flexible and convenient than vice versa.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn this modern world, people tend to use a simple way to create something or everything easier, particularly when the technology grows faster like this. People will be trying to utilize the advantages that are received by the growing technology in order to broaden their links and networks worldwide. I am gaining time to do anything else while doing my hobby. For example, I pick to hang out sometimes and do studying when I am in the cafe, hence, this will make me more convenient.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSecondly, I will be thrilled if I am able to work and study from a long distance using facilities such as e-learning, television, or the internet to understand the material given by the professor, as this will help me to work from anywhere while studying and working at the same time. For instance, currently I am working in Jakarta, and if there is an opportunity to get a degree again but it is way too far, then I will be in the online learning system, as this will help me so much because this opportunity would not come twice for me. So, leveraging any merits in the modern era would make everything easier for me.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, learning offline would be beneficial as people would see each other and give more appreciation to each other, but I do not agree because sometimes people do not interact that much with others. Also, there is another way to appreciate someone, such as by mailing them to show appreciation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that living in the modern world would benefit us in many ways, particularly by giving us the opportunity to enjoy the online learning material system where we can enjoy doing our hobbies or allocate time to do anything like work to be more productive in any way.'",

For example, instead of driving long hours on the road by themselves, with a convenient Fast-track infrastructure which commutes people to their desired destinations in the fastest way,  people can reduce the amount of time so they can do other work during that or have some relaxing time. However, this idea might suffer from several difficulties such as the complexity of cities' structure and long period of construction.This affects the lives of inhabitants due to the inconvenience of high traffic congestion , also noise and air pollution in the area that is built. \r\n\r\nThus, the idea of enhancing current public transport is easier to access. I am convinced that these improvements are more money-saving than creating new ones since the government only pay little expense on repairing the facilities of shared transport and maintenance fees every year with a short-period fixing to increase the experience of commuters .In addition, authorities can also expand more long tracks and provide 24/7 serving hours for these transportation which can help people to travel to distant locations without the worries of far or late night travelling which might be dangerous and become a potential target of the crime if they are driving alone at the middle of the night.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the allure of innovative fast train routes is undeniable, the practicality and efficiency of investing in the improvement of existing public transportation systems cannot be overlooked. By prioritizing the enhancement of current infrastructure, governments can address immediate commuter needs while laying the foundation for sustainable and inclusive urban mobility solutions.'",

The writer believes that have a more and more serious impact on society.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that some careers can be changed by robots or artificial intelligence because that is the technology era. Many scientists who want to help people in the workplace, invent a range of robots and electronic devices. Not only the robots can work accurately, but also the power is unlimited and the efficiency is very high . Moreover, the ability to solve the details of them is very correct and decreases the time . For instance , in Japan, robots can operate flexibly, working in many different harsh and dangerous environmental conditions to serve mining tasks and support production to achieve great productivity, replacing human  work. With heavier or more complex jobs to bring optimal quality and contribute significantly to the national GDP.\r\n\r\nI believe that the shift of negative changes in robots is  capable of replicating human emotions. The best artificial intelligence devices can do so far is to mimic basic facial expressions and  voice their concerns. However , this is no different from displaying an error message when there is an obstruction in their pre-programmed workflow.

Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In many countries, some people think that allowing children to make their own choices results in a selfish personality, while others think that making decisions themselves is necessary. Although making up their minds based on their choices may bring about a self-thinking personality, I strongly believe that making decisions by themselves allows children to drive their own lives, leading to an improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nRegarding this point, making decisions by themselves provides opportunities for individuals to facilitate adaptability and problem-solving skills. The business world is ever-changing, requiring individuals to live with responsibility. For instance, if individuals find themselves in trouble as a result of making their own decisions, they would reflect on their own choices. This experience develops the chance to make changes and assess their life direction. As a result, choosing for themselves enables individuals to live a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, making their own choices is likely to result in being selfish. Adults need to teach what matters happen when children make wrong decisions. Children haven\u2019t experienced enough of life, and they don\u2019t have the criteria for understanding others. This is the reason that children are protected by laws until the age of 20. In this regard, leaving the responsibility to children is likely to result in a lack of understanding.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, learning by themselves rather than mere teaching by adults should be a higher priority. To experiment directly can lead to finding genuine fulfillment, thereby significantly raising the value of responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while teaching in advance allows many children not to make wrong decisions, I believe that learning by themselves is more significant, as learning responsibility should be prioritized.'",

They think they will accomplish their tasks, but they might put their colleagues at risk of getting infected. In my opinion, I believe that a sick person should take a break from work to concentrate on their health and increase productivity.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons for my opinion is that when a person gets ill, their body cannot work properly. During sickness, our body feels exhausted, and our brain is not in a good position because of stress. As a result, it affects our mental health, and a person can go into depression to meet their deadline and work in their sick condition. That's why it is better to take a day off, stay at home, and get rest so that they can relax and concentrate on their health. We need to know the value of our health and take good care of it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, another reason why most employees opt to go to the office in their sick conditions is that they want to complete their tasks before deadlines to increase their productivity. An organization or a company's success depends on the working conditions of its employees. If a worker gets ill but still chooses to work, then this will affect the productivity of the company. In this condition, a person cannot focus on their task properly despite their dedication to completing their task. This might result in some mistakes in their work despite their hard work affecting productivity. Therefore, a person must prioritize their health for their own and their company's sake and should avoid going to work during illness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is good that people are dedicated to their work; however, it is better to avoid working in sickness to focus on their health and their company's success.'",

To my point of view being\r\n\r\n both sociable and qualified is needed to fulfil most of the jobs nowadays.\r\n\r\nAs far as knowledge and experience is concerned, some jobs do need specialities. For instance, if you want to take the chance to work as a doctor you should have a degree from a university, that you have been trained as a doctor and are qualified. Regarding this issue, the higher the rank of the university you studied in, the more chance you have to get better job offers. Furthermore, being qualified and having experience on a special subject are crucial to some employers and they would not take the risk of inexperienced staff, since it may endanger their credit and respect. \r\n\r\nBeing able to socialize with others plays a pivotal role in everyone's life these days, especially if you want to take a job which is based on this quality. Salesmen or online customer supports, for example, they need to talk and persuade customers, whether to buy their products or reassure them, that they will have good service, as support for their goods, So having an extroverted personality could be the matter of winning or losing the chance to move up the career ladder in any kind of job.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that employees should have special qualities such\r\n\r\n as being sociable and experience in all fields they are going to work in, and none of which is more important than another one.'",

This is because, with industrialism, uncountable vehicles and industrial factories release toxic gas into the atmosphere and plenty of individuals and companies throw out a mount of litter into the rivers, oceans, and soils. This obviously leads individuals to intake polluted food and water and this in turn results in severe diseases such as cancer, asthma, and dermatosis.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, although a majority of conservationists make an effort to save the world, a decrease in biodiversity occurs. In actual fact, studies undertaken by experts have revealed that polluted areas rarely find general animals and plants and confusingly convert natural food chains, so this has a fatal influence on endangered species.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the world faces a wide range of other concerns. The developing countries struggle with poverty and famine and the global strives to prevent deadly world wars in  Europe. this, therefore, the first priority of the world for the next generation can be changed all the time.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the world faces a wide range of other concerns but the earth has been destroyed by individuals and a decrease in biodiversity occurs.

People have a wide sprit of belief that this is a popular subject in debate.

They might say that it helps people to get rid of the monotonous feelings of having home food always. Human beings love to try out various foods therefore people tend to go out and have food from restaurants. If the government increases the price of junk foods, people have to face difficulties affording food.\r\n\r\nAs people constantly eat fast food, they suffer from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol at a young age.

What solutions could be used to tackle the situation?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, people are moving to the cities. Therefore, cities are suffering from this challenge globally. The main problem is the lack of jobs for residents of rural areas. One solution to this problem could be distributing supermarkets and industries to the countryside.\r\n\r\nThese days, the shortage of jobs obligates individuals to migrate to the cities. Unfortunately, this problem is not only one city but cities across the world suffering this challenge. This problem has been created due to job seekers. For example, those who are living in rural areas are busy working in factories or supermarkets that are located in the cities, in this case for time efficiency they prefer being in the cities.\r\n\r\nDistributing industries to the countryside can be one solution for keeping people in rural areas. Most of this problem is due to a large number of people who are looking for jobs. Therefore, the government should make plans or policies to contribute the source of work (supermarkets, industries) to the rural area. It proved the cities without noses, crowed, and air pollution moreover, it led the rural residents to save the money that has been being spent on public transport or private cars oil. Consequently, moving industries to rural areas is the best way to tackle the following problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people globally preferred moving town. It faces cities to challenge. It is due to job seekers or lack of work for local residents. The solution to this challenge is that the government should contribute to factories in rural areas.'",

However, the author of this essay disagrees with this statement due to youngsters\u2019 gaining various knowledge and the flexibility of combining studying and playing.\r\n\r\n    It is crucial to acknowledge that many programs on TV will make it easier for young people to know more about different aspects of knowledge. This is because lots of diverse educational shows on TV which are specially designed for children will give various important information and provide numerous valuable learning experiences. Likewise, a lot of genres and contents of games which contain historical, scientific or social elements will create a flexible learning environment for teenagers. This will be the place where children can access many useful lessons which they may have not studied at school without being bored and uninterested.\r\n\r\n   Another point to take into consideration is the youngsters\u2019 opportunities to entertain and obtain knowledge at the same time. Nowadays, numerous games require active and strategic thinking will need adolescents to develop many necessary skills from dealing with their problems to adapting unexpecting situations while they are taking part in their plays which inadvertently helps children to form their habits of thinking quickly. Moreover, by listening to a great deal of English songs on TV, teenagers will be able to learn a foreign language effectively as they remember what they like to hear. Thus, those devices not only bring entertainment but also help young people to become knowledgeable.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, watching films and playing computers do not always have negative effects on youngsters as they contribute great learning environment and combine relaxing and accessing information. This essay has presented that those activities can benefit children\u2019s cognitive abilities.'",

Why is so much news dedicated to bad news?\r\n\r\nShould the news focus on good news instead?' \n 'Text': 'The issue of news in today's fast-paced world has sparked a heated debate among many. It is widely argued that news could be both important and narrow down to bad things. This essay will explore the significance of news in modern society, examine the reasons behind the focus on adverse events, and discuss the potential benefits of a more balanced approach to news reporting.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the pivotal role of news is the ability to get access to life-saving information by news. For example, we can get an alert about earthquakes, military invasions, thereby potentially safeguarding our lives. \r\n\r\nHowever, a strong focus on bad news might lead to anxiety and exponentially increase stress levels. I assume the main cause of concentrating on bad news lies in human mental nature. People easily get scared and start scrolling through the news feed hoping to regain control. \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, imperative to strike a delicate balance in news reporting. Incorporating a more holistic approach that not only highlights the challenges we face but also celebrates human achievements and positive developments can contribute significantly to a healthier societal outlook. By doing so, news media can continue to fulfill their essential role in society while also promoting a more optimistic and resilient community.\r\n\r\nOverall,  while the importance of news cannot be overstated, the nature of its content holds profound implications for societal well-being. News organizations should be mindful of their responsibility not just to inform but also to contribute to the cultivation of an informed and hopeful society.'",

There seem to be two main problems stemming from this situation, and also two steps we could take to address it fully.\r\n\r\nPossibly the major problem is the huge question of how to collect, process and dispose of this material. Household waste comprises elements ranging from foodstuffs to metal, paper and plastics, and local authorities sometimes struggle to handle such a diverse mix of material. The historical solution has been incineration or landfill, but the problems of pollution and long-term ground contamination which arise have led to widespread efforts to recycle at least some of the waste. This leads us to the second concern, which is the high cost of disposing of refuse in an ecologically sound manner. We would all wish as much as possible of our rubbish to be recycled (for example by paper pulping or reusing plastics) but the expense involved must be met by higher taxes and charges for households.\r\n\r\nRegarding possible solutions, probably the most immediate short-term solution would be to divert far more government funds into waste processing and recycling facilities at a local level. This would reduce the environmental impact of the waste by reducing pollution, and also lower our demand for raw materials, as more recycled products would consequently be produced. A further, longer-term solution might be to raise the level of public understanding for the need to consume less material in households, especially in terms of packaging and wasted food. A campaign of education along these lines would gradually lessen the volume of waste, especially if reinforced by incentives for consuming less and penalties for excessive waste, as we see being trialled in the UK at present.\r\n\r\nOverall, the main problems are both environmental and financial. The possible solutions involve more immediate investment in facilities, and also encouraging long-term changes in household behaviour.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'As people's awareness of environmental protection declines, some people think that we need to find a way to live with climate change rather than prevent it. However, I consider that people need to focus on how to prevent climate change.\r\n\r\n First of all, finding a method to live with it could result in a waste of financial and human resources. A wonderful method to enable people to live with adverse weather conditions means that it requires more technological support and economic support, potentially leading to significant financial and manpower resources being expended. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the method would be successful. It's obvious that technological development is not mature enough now, on this basis, it is difficult to find a perfect solution to tackle this problem. Consequently, there are various negative impacts on finding a way to live with climate rather than preventing it from happening.\r\n\r\n Looking at it from another perspective, there are also some significant effects of climate change, which severely impact society. For example, drought conditions severely impact crop yields, while some stormy weather can cause extensive damage to infrastructure and loss of personal property. Such destruction seriously impacts human lives and economic development. Additionally, due to this decision people don't avoid climate change, which probably leads to more destruction of the environment. The reason is that people's awareness of environmental conservation becomes weaker as they consider that there is always a way to handle the problem rather than they face the problem themselves, though the issue is caused by themselves.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, although some people think that we need to find a way to live with climate change rather than prevent it, I still think that people need to focus on how to prevent climate change.'",

However, success also requires a fair share of luck combined with some social networking.\r\n\r\nIn terms of personality, if one is both responsible and ambitious, they should be able to reach triumph in life. In other words, a person who can manage themselves in life is often the same one who finds themselves in a position where success is around the corner due to how they present themselves in their affairs. Being determined, on the other hand, is a passive skill which guides people towards their goals. This trait is one that can be found in any successful individual, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk; people who have set their goals on a certain task, accomplished it and now their lives are in the history books.\r\n\r\nTo be successful, one cannot rely solely on their character, but also on life\u2019s unfathomable luck and people they interact with. As for  luck, a lot of success stories have a similar factor, simply being a the right place at the right time. This can be seen in a lot of movies, where the stories only make sense when one small piece of luck enables the main character to find their dream. Additionally, the people you know can also influence greatly on where your life ends up. To illustrate, by knowing the right person, and befriending them, one could gain a position in a company based on friendship alone, not necessarily requiring any skills besides their own social ones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in order to find success, one needs to take charge of their life\u2019s path, by not just waiting for lucky opportune moments, but also getting to know the right people on their desired road to success.

For instance, after graduating , young workers move to foreign countries like Australia to work as fruit pickers. \r\n\r\nAlthough moving to another part of the world sounds attractive , it can lead to many issues for the welcoming country ;  More often, people move to big cities in order to find a job easily, which can sometimes, generate overpopulation and fluctuating unemployment rate in the whole nation. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the movement of population is mostly made by plane, which is the most polluting way of travel. \r\n\r\nWe may need to be careful of these consequences and the solution could be to quantify the amount of people moving.

Do the advantages ouyweigh the disadvantages' \n 'Text': 'Many people believe that children should learn a foreign language other than their mother tongue and they should start it at primary school. I completely agree with this proposed idea because I believe that children at much younger ages are more receptive to new subjects and have greater learning ability. In addition, in older age during high school, foreign language has already been introduced to them so they feel less burdened with additional subjects.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that children have greater potential to learn new things at a younger age. For example, based on one research that has been carried out on school-age pupils in Iran, researchers compared the learning ability of elementary school children with older students and realized that younger children have a higher ability to learn the English language faster and more fluently than older ones. Therefore, it makes more sense to introduce the language course at an early age.\r\n\r\nMoreover, high school students have to study many advanced subjects during their academic years so if a new foreign language course is introduced to their difficult curriculum this means an additional burden on them and as a consequence, they will get frustrated and focus less on that. To be more precise, in this case, the purpose of learning a second language which is the optimal use of it will not be achieved or they will need the extra effort and time to master that language.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, based on what mentioned above, learning new subjects including a second language needs to be introduced to children in their earlier ages because they have more potential to learn and master that subject compared with the older age.'",

I am the person who agrees with the second one, and I will elaborate my point of view in following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo start with, banning those sports may result in some problems. For example, diving is a pretty risky sport. If people stop doing that, we will not have that sort of talented people in the future. Why do we need that kind of people? Because they can rescue someone in the ocean, sea, lake, and so on. Firefighters and special force members are trained in many types of serious environments. They are helping people. Therefore, I support that we can choose to do it or not.\r\n\r\nJuveniles are easily affected by peers. As a result, they are more likely to do some things which are considered adventures. However, those are the things with lots of hazards, such as speed riding, fighting, parkour, and so forth. Every year, some youngsters pass away because of participating in one sport. I think maybe it is a good idea to limit it for teenagers. All ages could take part in these exercises. However, adolescents are the most serious age group.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, some people like to take risks and do those for fun. Some people became professional players and trainers.

According to an announcement by the government, the number of people using parks is declining these days because of severe dust in the air. Thus, they argue it is better to establish new spaces for workers rather than disburse the expenditures for managing the parks.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people presume that the park should be remained for the local people. It is mainly because it is ideal for people to enjoy their leisure time, such as reading a book, playing badminton, and jogging with their pets. A number of children are used to come out to do outdoor activities with their friends or parents. Moreover, it is also good for the workers to release their stress in the park as it is close to workplace.\r\n\r\nThe park needs to remain in our lives. It would be helpful not only to enjoy the natural habitat but also to refresh people's minds in the hustle and bustle of life.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the park needs to remain in our lives. I believe that it would be helpful not only to enjoy the natural habitat but also to refresh people's minds in the hustle and bustle of life.'",

Do you think this will have a positive or negative impact on society?' \n 'Text': 'In this era, human workplaces are being replaced by the development of robots and AI. This writer believes that it is the high productivity and automation that make robots and AI  work better than humans and this is a positive change.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that robots and AI can bring better results in performance as they can work productively and automatically. This is because they are programmed to do certain jobs and can deal with complicated tasks accurately. Furthermore, robots and AI do not need to relax so they can work for a long time. As a result, when the robots and AI do a better job than humans. It will replace some jobs in the future such as receptionist. For example, Samsung company has made a redundant and many people run into unemployment situation, because a variety of the manufacturing process are replaced by robots and AI.\r\n\r\nTaking the benefits of AI and robots into account, i believe it is true to say that they can bring a positive development to  society. For this reason, applying technology and automatic machines to the industrial process can promote the social economy. As a consequence, many investors will invest in  local companies and help the community become more modern. Take Ho Chi Minh City as an example, it can be seen that the economy of this city has increased rapidly after revolutionizing the way of manufacturing from hand-made to robots.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, AI and robots are changing human roles as they can perform productively and automatically. Therefore, using them in the manufacturing process can bring a lot of positive change to  society'",

Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There seems to be a lack of consensus in the way we live our lives. While some people argue that it is better to do the same activities and ignore drastic changes in your routine, others, including myself, believe that changes in life always come with beneficial improvements. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both ideas in detail.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons why some people think that change in life is always beneficial. Firstly, sticking to a monotonous daily schedule can cause many mental problems for the individual. Some psychologists believe that people with a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to suffer from depression than others. Secondly, according to his opinion, people who experience different situations and are ready for change are more successful. For example, a person who has a disorganized occupation that does not match their interests finds themselves depriving themselves of other careers that would give them a sense of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group claims that incorporating new things into our daily routine would be problematic. \r\n\r\nThey emphasize that if people want to be on the safe side, they should avoid change. In this regard, it is more likely that long-term employees receive promotions than workers who change their occupations in a short period of time. Moreover, they know the feeling of peace in their monotonous life rather than living in stressful situations and as a result prefer not to be a risk taker.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, quality of life is more valuable than lifespan. Thus, while routines provide comfort, we cannot continue the steps to success and enjoy our lives without being open to change.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding the changes. Others, however think that changes is always a good thing. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.'",

Developed countries usually give money to undeveloped countries, however, it may not solve poverty and I strongly believe there should be transformation to resolve in the ways that give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.\r\n\r\n     Firstly, education is the best key to the growth of any population. If people have training overseas, it will lead to creating employment and they will sell their national products and services.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Mongolia, people were sent to China last year for training in making clothes.\r\n\r\nHowever, now they make clothes and export them abroad. Moreover, developed countries can offer expertise and resources to help build infrastructure, improve healthcare systems.\r\n\r\n     Secondly, financial aid does not reach the people who need it and often ends up in the hands of corrupt governments or institutions. In many poor countries, corruption and mismanagement are rampant, misallocating wealth and perpetuating poverty. In addition, financial aid often comes with strings attached such as imposing policies that favor the interests of donor countries over those of recipients. This can lead to the exploitation of resources and exploitation of the poor.\r\n\r\n     \u00a0In conclusion, while it is a good-willed gesture, financial aid alone is not the solution to poverty in developing countries.

The author suggests that while this transition may enhance competitiveness in the workplace, it could also have negative implications for human well-being.\r\n\r\nIndustries reliant on precise procedures and large-scale production find the use of robotic devices for complex tasks to be a logical choice. This allows skilled workers to focus on more intricate responsibilities beyond the capabilities of robots, thereby optimizing workforce potential and business efficiency. A local newspaper documented a significant profit increase for a children's toy manufacturing company following the integration of AI into their production processes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the drawbacks of depending on robots and AI must be acknowledged. Many companies view these technologies as offering superior productivity and mental resilience compared to human workers, leading to a trend of replacing human employees with AI-driven counterparts capable of prolonged, uninterrupted work. This may result in a rise in unemployment, especially among workers lacking specialized skills, who may struggle to find well-paying jobs. Forced to accept low-skilled positions to meet their financial needs, they risk career stagnation and miss out on future advancement opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn summary, critics argue that the growing adoption of robots and AI in the workplace stems from business leaders aiming to enhance profitability through the utilization of non-human resources. However, this shift could exacerbate unemployment as many workers find it challenging to compete with AI-driven systems.'",

What are the possible effects?' \n 'Text': 'These days, many people have been inclined to change their appearance with the help of plastic surgery. There are several reasons behind this issue such as the beauty standards of the modern world and improvements in medicine. As a result, individuals can mostly endanger their health in order to look better and waste a lot of money.\r\n\r\nThere are some factors why people have opted to use esthetic operations in recent years. One main reason is that people\u2019s views about beauty have completely altered, particularly since the 21st century. In the past, most males and females were prone to look simpler and more natural rather than now. Therefore, they were obsessed with the way they appeared to the others. However, now this tendency depends on artificial methods like plastic operations. Secondly, the quality of this type of surgery is increasing every day because technological developments are also observed in medical fields as well as other areas. So, they can take the responsibility of highly developed and perilous operations which might assist people to look natural and beautiful.\r\n\r\nAlthough these surgeries have become more reliable and safer, they have several side effects on the human body and patients\u2019 economic situation. The essential items that doctors use in esthetic operations generally contain toxic chemicals and negatively impact people\u2019s health. For instance, plastic which is used by doctors may pose a threat to human skin and lead to some diseases such as injuries in the skin and even cancer. Moreover, these operations may cost a great amount of money because sometimes subsequent surgeries can be demanded in order to correct previous operations. Therefore, it can have adverse effects on people\u2019s financial condition.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people\u2019s opinions about standards of beauty and cutting-edge technologies used in medicine are the main causes underlying this problem.

Nevertheless, once these things dominate the company entirely, there would be no place for a regular employee. As a result, the unemployment rate would increase significantly and this would pose a dangerous risk to the stability of the society as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnother point that is worth mentioning is the increasing use of robots stems from the advantage of energy saving.

The writer acknowledges this problem is attributed to numerous factors, leading to a negative effect on  society.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons causing this issue relating to manufacturing error decrease. By inventing robots, people can apply them for mass products that require  long-term manufacturing, limiting the mistakes or accidents that can occur if using labour. As a result, employers can not only decline the money paying for workers but also the amount for broken products, aiding them in finance sectors. This trend continuously happens all around the world, especially in huge companies relating to cars, motorbikes and other vehicles, where we can solely witness a sign of humans  controlling and adjusting the robots.\r\n\r\nDespite providing financial benefits to  employers, the adverse impact of this on the whole society is undeniable. With the appearance of artificial intelligence, there are no more tasks for humans, resulting in  considerable unemployment rates. These people will struggle with financial burdens and end up being in harsh conditions or homeless. Additionally, when receiving  support from robots, individuals can easily overdepend on them, limiting their creativity and the skills they should have gained from work experience. Although robots are generated to assist people\u2019s lives, the situation where unemployment rates and lack of core skills are increasingly high cannot be observed as the pictures of our targeted society.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the demand of employers for human error avoidance in the manufacturing process is the main cause for the replacement of robots in the workforce.

Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages of damaging such areas?' \n 'Text': 'There is a school of thought that advocates for the exploration of oil and gas in remote and untouched natural habitats due to the ever-increasing demand for energy sources of oil and gas. Despite these products serving numerous aspects of human life, they also cause environmental damage, I believe that the advantages do not outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, exploring more gas and oil resources has found several benefits such as an industrial revolution and tackling various financial and employment issues. Firstly, the gas and oil industry necessitates a large amount of labour to explore the resources. Thus, it will provide a variety of opportunities to work for unemployed individuals. Secondly, new abundant resources bring economic value for the nations which own these resources to export broadly. In addition, residents of the nation's resources are served these resources at affordable cost. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, new gasoline and oil resource exploitation also encounter various downsides. Firstly, humans' exploitation of natural resources obviously damages the environment such as deforestation which results in the destruction of habitats and the loss of biodiversity. Moreover, deforestation contributes to the loss of habitats, threatening many plant and animal species. In addition, according to recent reports, discovering and exploiting resources exacerbate climate change problems, especially the greenhouse effect. Lastly, gas and oil resources are limited resources so overwhelming exploitation can threaten or even harm the ecology of the earth.\r\n\r\nWith all of the aforementioned theses and explanations, the conclusion is self-evident.

Does this development have more advantages or disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Payment using mobile phones started from the era of smartphone use. When people are using smartphones, many developers see this as an opportunity to create more convenient ways for smartphone usage, especially in payment. Payment using mobile phones is normally used nowadays. Even though this technology has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to using this. In this essay, I will explain some of my views on this technology which I believe there are more advantages than disadvantages.\r\n\r\nWe cannot deny that payment using mobile phones is very convenient, we can pay for something in seconds at any time and anywhere as long we have a connection to the internet. This payment method also makes transactions faster, simpler, and effective. Some of the developers also add extra security features such as one-time passwords, biometrics, or tokens that make users feel safer when doing transactions. With all of these advantages, we can see that businesses nowadays are rapidly increasing in speed, and volume, and also they are also expanding quickly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, cyber crime also increasing lately. Even though payment through mobile phones has many security features, there is also a loophole that many irresponsible people use to take advantage of this technology. One of the common crime that almost happens to everyone is their data leaked. The hacker collects this data and sells it to another company for a database or worse makes a fake account for their own business. The next disadvantage is also we might spend more than we need because of the convenience of payment and the small amounts of things we purchase.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while payment using mobile phones is an effective way for transactions, I think it is also better if the security of payment can be more developed so as users we can use payment safely and make business grow faster and bigger.'",

In addition to this, it will affect the agriculture field as well because some of the farmers grow it and export it to different countries that use it to make medication.Banning it will create a huge impact in some fields.\r\n\r\nShifting towards views of agreement, due to high usage of this drug it leads to severe chronic illness like cancer, lung problems and many more.To explain,as it is available without money and people do not know its drawbacks they start getting addicted especially  people who are under the poverty line and low income.For example, according to 'An Indian' 2019 survey there is 75% of  transport drivers have kidney issues and asthma problems and it is also mentioned that they smoke 3 or 4 times a day.Hence,the government should declare the usage of tobacco as lawbreaking.\r\n\r\nFurther strengthening views due to addiction among youth.In today's competitive era, young minds are always under stress for jobs ,for competitive exams and studies so they start taking drugs in the form of cigarettes, chewing gums and many more.Moreover, they start becoming addicted to it.Even though these days cigars  come smokeless  it is hard for families to find that their children are using drugs.Due to these things young death rates have increased.For instance,according to WHO(World Health Organisation) charts ,it is found that 8 out of 10  kids are addicted to vapes.Thus,declaring it illegal will create a positive impact on pupils.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,although it has some positive uses yet prohibiting it will save many young lives and I also strongly believe that forbidding it will be beneficial for youth and many people aliveness.'",

To explain it, if children are given time for painting and drawing subjects which get their attention more than another syllabus then they will not be able to concentrate on science subjects due to a lack of interest in these challenging curriculum, thus, they would not opt other career paths except art subjects.\r\n\r\nShifting towards the view of agreement, implementing art lessons not only decreases student's stress but also sharpen their thinking skills. To elaborate , today's younger receive a lot of work from their mathematics and other curriculum instructors which leads them towards depression, therefore, if these subjects are applied in pupil's school curriculum then they will divert their attention towards fun activities and it will assist them to reduce some burden from their mind. For instance, a survey  conducted by Harward University in 2016 found that some schools added art subjects and students are more excited than before as they enjoy painting and drawing along with challenging subjects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these essential subjects are also  a fact of a successful life as some students show their hidden talents by painting and earn a lot of money by choosing this career. For example, a headline  shown in an international newspaper that in India 55% of people who are disabled draw paintings and earn money for their families, consequently, these subjects become a source of poor and disabled people's income.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, applying some interesting syllabus in the school curriculum not only mitigates children's stress but also assists in earning money by showing their hidden talents with the help of painting and drawing.'",

I believe separation promotes independence, self-reliance as well as personal development and I discuss this in the upcoming paragraphs .\r\n\r\nTo begin with, living away from family trains people how to live their own life. In other words, the young generation must learn how to manage everything such as financial expenses, bills, fees , grocery budgets and so on which would be beneficial for their successful future. For example, an International survey  has shown that 80% of students migrate for their higher study in different countries and they are brilliant in management rather than others who are living with their parents with no responsibility,consequently, they are at higher risk of failure in their career than those who are experienced in management in their early twenties.\r\n\r\nSecondly, parents who agree with their children to shift themselves somewhere else are those who want their children's personal growth as if they independently connected with other people without their parent's support to become more successful in their work career. For instance, interacting with more and more outside people who are successful in their lives assists children to follow their path and socially become sharp-minded and connect with the modern world, as a result, they live up-to-date by joining brilliant people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, living outside of home not only sharpens youngster's mind but also provides them more confidence to interact with prestigious people who guide them on how to be successful as well as aware them of upcoming technology'",

This essay will examine more about what are, benefits and the\r\n\r\ndrawbacks of this tendency.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using care homes alternatively is helping elders to make new friends. In comparison with staying at home, people who live in nursing homes have more activities during the day which are playing chess or basically sitting down and having a cup of tea about their young life together. In addition, the commitment to great health care service is considered by elders' families. Especially, the old-age people can reach not only the careful treatment from friendly staff but also the benefits from public health policy.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there are significant disadvantages that can bring sadness to elderly people. Firstly, it means that elders do not have any meaningful moments with their modern families even memorial happiness.

Even if the old age people already have great assistance services, families are always the most important and indispensable place for old age people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, nursing homes or care homes might be suitable services for elderly people, but staying at home will usually offer a better choice for saving their affordable memorials and showing their families' responsibility as well.

Discuss the effects this might have on society.' \n 'Text': 'In today's fast-paced world, an increase in the length of life expectancy has become a real concern among  society. This essay  will explore the reasons behind it such as improved healthcare systems and some of the effects that can have an impact on countries such as overpopulation. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, one of the primary reasons is the sophisticated healthcare systems. Today, many diseases can be treated via cutting-edge technological tools compared to past times. In past days, there were limited numbers of healthcare facilities but today nearly in all cities, hospitals are built and people can access them easily. Another underlying cause of this phenomenon is the high quality of life that many developed countries have. They provide their citizens with wide-ranging opportunities that contribute to a better lifestyle. \r\n\r\nTurning to the effects of longer life expectancies, a major problem is  overpopulation. As people live longer and new generations come, countries suffer from overpopulation. This issue contributes to the depletion of natural resources which is a growing concern for future generations. Another impact that overpopulation gives rise to is the lack of space. As the number of people rises, there will be a need to live in. Based on this reasoning, many green spaces are knocked down and converted into residential areas. \r\n\r\nAll in all, the extended life expectancy of the people has become a topic of debate. This issue has its own causes such as developments in medical science and high standards of living that the countries offer. Besides its causes, it has many devastating impacts on  society such as overpopulation and shortage of natural resources.'",

However, it has also engendered new challenges and inequalities. Nonetheless, there are still some solutions available to address them.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news, which not only undermines the integrity of public discourse but also exacerbates societal divisions and erodes trust in traditional media sources. Moreover, the digital divide persists, with marginalized communities facing limited access to the Internet and thereby being denied the educational, economic, and social opportunities. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, privacy violations and data breaches pose significant threats to individuals' autonomy and security in the digital age. The unchecked collection and monetization of personal data without informed consent raise serious ethical and legal questions, necessitating robust regulatory frameworks to protect user privacy and data rights.\r\n\r\nTo effectively address these challenges, governments, technology companies, civil society organizations, and individuals must collaborate to implement multifaceted solutions. This includes enacting comprehensive legislation to regulate online content, promote digital literacy, and bridge the digital divide through infrastructure investments and community outreach programs. Tech companies must also prioritize user privacy and transparency in data practices, fostering a culture of responsible innovation and accountability.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and live, it also presents complex challenges that require concerted efforts to mitigate. By fostering collaboration and innovation, we can harness the transformative potential of the Internet while safeguarding against its negative consequences, ensuring a more equitable and inclusive digital future for all.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Spoken communication is more powerful than written communication. To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: orally and in written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people.'",

There are still many people who believe in superstitions like ghosts. Particularly in the old houses that withstand years of different generations of ownership. There is a possibility that suicide or murder happened all those years ago, and the current occupant is afraid the lingering souls will come for them and disturb their peaceful lives.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the best solutions for people to explore, is to reach out to the senior residents in their neighbourhood.

What is your opinion?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, selfishness has become increasingly prominent. Some argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the lack of caring for others, which alleviates kindness. It is my contention that kind-heartedness can improve mental health and promote adequate standards for future generations, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of mental well-being. For example, psychologist Edwin Charles mentions that the brain releases large amounts of dopamine when showing kindness, which in return stimulates one's brain to be happier. Moreover, almost 80% of suicides are caused by a lack of kindness. Thus, without even knowing it, being friendly to a stranger can decrease depression and trauma for them. Therefore, it is evident that pure actions might both improve someone's own mentality and others. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is essential to underscore the impact that modern actions could have on humans in the foreseeable future. To illustrate this, anthropologist Kathy Steward explains that 50% of an individual's  actions are influenced by their parents. Given this, the concatenation of moral values and standards that are being taught to today's children could be learned by their offspring, which continues the cycle of rudeness; unless it is stopped and replaced with kindness. Hence, humbleness can create a beter life for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is notable that kindness can increase mental health and promote the quality of life. It is my opinion that if kindness is disseminated throughout the globe, then the lives of all humans can benefit.'",

They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are required to make people recycle more of their waste?' \n 'Text': 'In today's society, environmental sustainability has witnessed transformative innovation. With the rise of environmental awareness, the question of  whether waste recycling in households is sufficient has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts argue that governments should enact laws to regulate and encourage recycling. From my perspective, while laws may help improve recycling rates, they are not the sole solution to increasing recycling.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that legal mandates can effectively raise awareness and encourage compliance with recycling practices. When recycling is legally required, individuals are more likely to take it seriously and incorporate it into their daily routines. Moreover, enforcement mechanisms such as fines or penalties can incentivize compliance and deter individuals from neglecting their recycling responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on legislation to promote recycling overlooks the importance of education and public engagement. Laws can set the framework for recycling initiatives, but they may not address underlying issues such as lack of awareness or motivation. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines legal mandates with educational campaigns and community involvement is essential for long-term success in promoting recycling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, enforcing recycling laws may pose logistical challenges and strain resources, especially in regions with limited infrastructure or economic constraints. In such cases, alternative strategies such as incentivizing recycling through rewards or subsidies may be more effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while laws can be a valuable tool in promoting recycling, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes education, public engagement, and incentives. By adopting a multifaceted approach, governments can create a culture of sustainability and encourage responsible waste management practices among citizens.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'While some claim that leadership skill is an inborn quality of an individual, others believe that anyone also become a leader in the future thanks to practice. From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why leadership skill is a god-given talent is because a leader is the most important person in an organization or company due to their inborn qualities. This is because eminent leaders are the first people in the organization who can be under astounding pressure to work, and make decisions correctly and they have to have a long-sighted mindset to drive people successfully. Owing to this, if the parents are the leaders, unavoidably their children would become  leaders in the future thanks to inheritance and genetics. For example, as the Donald Trump president is a well-off businessman, the majority of his children are successful leaders in the incorporation of companies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that leadership skills can be developed in intensive practice without inborn qualities. The reason is that one also can become a perfect leader thanks to living in a sufficient environment because they will learn by trial and error and especially they have golden opportunities to practice frequently. Moreover, there are a lot of soft-skill courses  online from around the world about becoming a leader. For instance, current companies usually organize workshops about how to become a brilliant leader to enhance the soft skills of their employees.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why leadership skills can be a god-given talent, but in my opinion, it can be developed through hard-working practice and non-stop learning.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Should we invent a new language for people from different countries to use for the international communication? Do you think there are more benefits or more problems with it? Explain.' \n 'Text': 'The question of whether to invent a new language for international communication is a complex one, with both benefits and drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of creating a new language for people from different countries to use and argue that the potential problems outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, proponents of inventing a new international language argue that it could facilitate communication and foster greater understanding among people from different nations. With a common language, individuals could more easily collaborate on global issues such as climate change, trade, and diplomacy. Additionally, a new language could help to bridge cultural divides and promote a sense of unity among diverse populations.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite these potential benefits, there are several significant problems associated with inventing a new language for international communication. First and foremost, the process of creating a new language would be incredibly complex and time-consuming. Language is deeply intertwined with culture, history, and identity, and designing a language that is acceptable to people from diverse backgrounds would be a daunting task. Furthermore, even if a new language were successfully created, there is no guarantee that it would be widely adopted or accepted by the global community.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the practical challenges, there are also potential cultural and linguistic consequences to consider. The adoption of a new international language could lead to the erosion of linguistic diversity and the marginalization of minority languages and cultures. Language is not simply a means of communication; it is also a repository of cultural heritage and identity. By promoting a single global language, we risk homogenizing the rich tapestry of human language and culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the idea of inventing a new language for international communication may seem appealing in theory, the practical challenges and potential consequences outweigh the benefits. Rather than attempting to impose a single language on the world, we should instead focus on promoting multilingualism and language diversity. By respecting and preserving the linguistic richness of our planet, we can better appreciate the diversity of human culture and foster genuine understanding and cooperation among people from different countries.'",

There are many phases where a parent-child relationship changes and adulting is one of them. I believe that parents should allow their children to make their own decisions when they grow older. Furthermore, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we talk about childhood, kids are very much connected with their parents and we all have seen small kids who never leave their parents for a second. As time goes on, when they turn into a teenager, they try to maintain distance from their parents as kids are going through hormonal changes during that time. Finally, when children grow as  adults, they again come closer to their parents and try to connect with their parents in a limited way. For example, children will stay away from their parents when they are in grade 10 or 11 and as soon as they turn 24, they again will try to connect with their parents because by that time they have learned many things.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents should have limited involvement in their children's private life as they grow older. Parents should also change their roles from time to time. For example, when children were small the parents used to teach everything to their kids but when they grow older, they should understand their children's boundaries where they should allow them to make their own decisions and guide them whenever required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the role of the parents changes when their children grow older and to save their relationship, parents should allow their children to make their own decisions and guide them whenever it is necessary.'",

To what extent do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is debatable whether the improvement of people\u2019s lives is the most prominent purpose of science or not. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which this view is correct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, humanity inevitably faces various difficulties on the daily and solutions are required to handle these situations. Usage of science is by far the most convenient way of solving these problems; moreover, by carrying out scientific experiments, scientists come to conclusions which lead to accessing data capable of improving day-to-day life. For instance, air pollution has become a great issue nowadays and scientists have taken measures to address this problem. As a result, engines capable of using sources of energy other than fossil fuels have been produced; having a significant effect on reducing the pollution of air and in turn the increase of the quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince the tranquillity of individuals is paramount, it is understandable that the ultimate goal of science would have to be related to their lives;however, other factors are also of high importance; most notably  nature and its species. One particular problem that catches the attention is the extinction of different animal groups leading to the decrease of biodiversity. This matter should not be dismissed as nature is a vast source of data for reaching higher levels of knowledge and science should be used to handle this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as important as the improvement of daily life is, certain matters such as the safety of other living beings should not be overlooked, for they have a noticeable effect on the quality of life.'",

What solution can you\r\n\r\nsuggest?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad attitude among students. it is my contention that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricter rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aims to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, whom they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate in online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events causes momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there is the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screen time, internet availability or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home causes poor manners at school. Yet I believe, if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school.'",

As a result, the students' figure increased dramatically and making the distinction between genders is an ineffective method because the number of universities  should be doubled and this is completely a waste of money. Additionally, the figure of teachers will be faced with a shortage and there will be a large gap for educators and the quality of studies will not remain the same , consequently, there will be a significant decrease in community knowledge.

The debate over whether cities should make public transportation free of charge in metropolises has been longstanding,with a majority of people praising the benefits that it will bring to the cities. It is my contention that while benefits such as less traffic and improved air quality will be fulfilled afterwards, I would say the drawbacks are solely limited to the accumulation of crowding in alternative transportation vehicles due to the growth. \r\n\r\nMaking city transportation costless indeed has several advantages, and one of the most noticeable ones is alleviating congestion in capital cities. Many key cities around the world are facing the challenge of dealing with a large number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to long congestion lines. By providing free transportation, with support from government agencies, citizens are more likely to choose public vehicles for their travel needs. A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits. While it can alleviate  traffic congestion and improve air quality, it also poses a threat to cause overcrowding issues.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the trend ?' \n 'Text': 'Contemporary times see vast numbers of firms shifting to online platforms to arrange meetings. Certain individuals advocate that integrating people on the internet is a beneficial tool, while others believe that it has an extreme drawback for personnel. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of meeting online and provide a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technological investments provide us with well-equipped opportunities, such as comfort and flexibility. A myriad of well-known companies around the world altered their laws about meetings because of the contribution of technology. In this way, although the squad is in a formal meeting to discuss the firm's goals, they are likely to feel relaxed through the computer. For instance, departments could focus properly on their tasks due to some platforms when the earth struggled with the Corona-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the office, several strict rules for individuals are regulated by companies. In other words, staff work under pressure in the domain, yet when they strive to overcome some duties, the squad could arrange a break time at home. For instance, personnel might go somewhere since there is no one observing their actions at home.\r\n\r\nHowever, arranging a meeting on the online platform has some major disadvantages, such as distractions and troubles with connection. Generally, over three individuals live in the same home around the world, so institutes may encounter a myriad of issues created by the environment at home. For instance, a person with offspring is likely to be distracted during the meeting. Consequently, they are unlikely to concentrate on their duties. However, companies ought to consider their procedures for meetings since they have remarkable drawbacks for employees.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though talking with crowds on the online platform seems like an essential method, it has an extremely negative impact on corps' focus and their comfort zones.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is thought by some that  observation during sports is a method that a person can learn about teamwork and strategy, whereas the opponents of this notion take the view that people can learn such skills when they take part in sports. Although I agree that the former idea can be true in some cases, I would argue that the latter  can boost one's knowledge  about these skills. This essay will discuss both views.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some consider that watching sports plays a pivotal role in fostering many aspects of teamwork and strategy. By observing sports people can see what players are doing, and what actions and strategies they are using in order to win the competition. If someone decides to start sports, it may be a good method as in this approach they can learn more about such skills without being injured. Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way they can learn about how to be a part of a team. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy.'",

I would like to discuss both sides in more detail before giving my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous play because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, a young girl had a serious accident when she was climbing because it was raining and the path got slippery, this led to a result of her death. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that the residents should be encouraged to do all sports and activities that they like because not only does it provide a diverse range of play, but it is also the best way for players to explore their abilities as well as their passion to find talented seeds in the sports world. Additionally, this helps to increase the player\u2019s experience. For instance, a person is not good at swimming but she or he may be good at climbing. Thus if they do not have an opportunity to try to climb, they will not discover that they are good at it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to know that dangerous sports should not be agreed to by the law because of their negative consequences, such as causing serious accidents and death but communities should have the freedom to do any play or activity because it motivates more people to join the sports to find talented people.'",

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that traditional learning, presented by teachers, is not replaceable with other technology-driven approaches. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. \r\n\r\nSecondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly assume that common teaching methods will soon be replaced by various types of appealing, novell, and time and money-effective technological trends.'",

So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. \r\n\r\nParents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children.

Otherwise, if this is not respected, it can damage the contact between both of them.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, children await autonomy, emancipation and living on their own to be happy in life . If parents are too invasive, children become distant and the link could be broken . \r\n\r\nTo summarize, whilst parents have to give love and respect to their children to build a strong relationship, they also have to not be too invasive in order to keep a strong link between both of them.'",

In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.'",

In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations. In addition, to resist natural disasters, scientists should focus on human beings.'",

I believe this method is completely beneficial because will reduce accidents and provide more chances for us to use our time effectively.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, nowadays cars have a driver and a person has to do this responsibility, although, the next generation of cars will not need a person to work and this reformat will help humankind to use that time for other tasks. For example, reading the news, calling a friend or family member or doing simpler tasks such as relaxation. Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way. For instance , tesla cars have a program that can measure other drivers' habits and estimate their next move also they can share information with other cars and this algoritem is able to avoid dangerous activities and maximize safety.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, drivers have a large impact on industries and have different responsibilities if we eliminate their jobs, they will be unsatisfied and also face  many problems. However, any new technology needs some staff and equipment so governments can prepare some courses to teach those people to be adapted to new methods and they can fill this gap just with some education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, In my opinion, I totally agree with the replacement of drivers with new technology because it will help  humankind and reduce dangers.

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that it is done responsibly , especially when it comes to sensitive audiences like children. \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.\r\n\r\nOne pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nTo foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action. By addressing the pervasive influence of technology, promoting outdoor experiential learning in educational settings, and fostering community-based initiatives, it is conceivable to rekindle young individuals' affinity with nature. Ultimately, bridging the gap between young people and the natural environment is imperative for fostering a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the world around us.'",

This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the development of science benefits people\u2019s lives. Many invented cures and discoveries of technology bring people to a new era. For example, a hundred year before, someone who was infected by the flu close to died since there was no knowledge about the cure and how to prevent it. However, science has been growing, scientists invented the vaccine, and the public nowadays can live side by side with the flu. As a result, science saved many lives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, science aims to broaden people\u2019s knowledge to be aware of the environment. Many nations in this world do not have a good geography.

Firstly, childhood is given to a person once only. Children should live their childhoods, they should hang out with their friends, they should play outdoor games with their peers. Children should not be seen as  figures who should be responsible for many things at an early age.

In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on this matter.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the salary gap between senior and junior positions argue that it is unfair and undermines principles of equality and meritocracy. They contend that younger workers often possess comparable skills and qualifications to their senior counterparts and should be compensated accordingly. Additionally, maintaining a significant wage differential may demotivate junior employees and hinder their career progression, leading to dissatisfaction and turnover within the organization.\r\n\r\nHowever, proponents of higher salaries for senior positions argue that remuneration should reflect the level of responsibility, experience, and value brought to the organization. Senior employees typically have years of experience and expertise in their field, along with leadership roles that entail greater accountability and decision-making authority. As such, they argue that higher salaries for senior positions are justified as a recognition of these contributions and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while experience and expertise are undoubtedly valuable, the extent of the wage gap between senior and junior positions should be scrutinized to ensure fairness and transparency. Organizations should implement clear and objective criteria for determining salaries, taking into account factors such as performance, qualifications, and market standards. Additionally, efforts should be made to provide opportunities for career advancement and skill development for junior employees, thereby bridging the gap between senior and junior positions over time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate over salary differentials between senior and junior positions reflects competing priorities regarding fairness, meritocracy, and organizational value. While experience and leadership responsibilities warrant higher salaries for senior positions, it is essential to ensure that wage differentials are justified and transparent. By fostering a culture of equity and opportunity, organizations can promote employee satisfaction and long-term success.'",

What problems will this cause? What can be done to solve these problems?' \n 'Text': 'The preservation of old towns and cities presents a unique set of challenges in today's rapidly evolving urban landscape. While these historical settlements may have been well-suited and livable for people in previous centuries, they often face various problems in the modern era. In this essay, I will discuss the problems caused by the preservation of old towns and cities and propose solutions to address these challenges.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary problems associated with old towns and cities is outdated infrastructure and urban planning. Many of these settlements were designed for a smaller population and less vehicular traffic, leading to congestion, inadequate transportation systems, and deteriorating infrastructure. Additionally, historic buildings may lack modern amenities and compliance with safety and accessibility standards, posing risks to residents and visitors alike.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the preservation of old towns and cities can exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and gentrification. As these areas become popular tourist destinations or desirable neighborhoods for affluent residents, property values rise, displacing long-term residents and eroding the cultural fabric of the community. This phenomenon often leads to the loss of affordable housing and the marginalization of lower-income residents.\r\n\r\nTo address these problems, proactive measures must be taken to balance preservation with modernization and inclusivity. Firstly, investments should be made in upgrading infrastructure and urban amenities to meet the needs of residents and visitors while preserving the historical character of the area. This may involve improving transportation networks, restoring historic buildings, and enhancing public spaces for recreational and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, policies should be implemented to promote equitable development and affordable housing in old towns and cities. This could include the preservation of affordable housing stock, incentivizing mixed-income development, and providing support for local businesses and community initiatives. Engaging residents and stakeholders in the decision-making process is also crucial to ensure that preservation efforts are inclusive and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the preservation of old towns and cities presents challenges related to infrastructure, gentrification, and socioeconomic disparities, proactive measures can mitigate these issues. By investing in modernization while preserving historical integrity and promoting equitable development, old towns and cities can continue to thrive as vibrant and livable communities for generations to come.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'very few school children learn about the value of money and how to look after it, yet this is s critical skill that should be taught as part of the school curriculum. Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The lack of emphasis on teaching children about the value of money and financial management within the school curriculum is a glaring oversight with significant ramifications. I firmly agree that financial literacy is a critical skill that should be integrated into the educational framework from an early age. In this essay, I will elaborate on the importance of financial education in schools and discuss whether the current state of affairs represents a positive or negative development.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, instilling financial literacy in children equips them with essential life skills necessary for navigating the complexities of the modern world. Understanding concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions and cultivate responsible financial habits. Without proper guidance, young adults may fall prey to financial pitfalls such as overspending, debt accumulation, and lack of savings, leading to long-term financial instability and stress.\r\n\r\nMoreover, integrating financial education into the school curriculum promotes socioeconomic equality by leveling the playing field and providing all students, regardless of their background, with the tools to achieve financial independence. By fostering a culture of financial responsibility and empowerment, schools can help mitigate the cycle of poverty and equip future generations with the skills necessary to build a secure financial future for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, financial literacy education aligns with the broader goals of education in fostering holistic development and preparing students for adulthood. Just as schools teach subjects like mathematics and language arts to impart essential cognitive skills, teaching financial literacy ensures that students develop the practical skills needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected global economy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the absence of financial literacy education in schools represents a significant oversight with far-reaching implications. Integrating financial education into the curriculum is imperative to empower students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the intricacies of personal finance and achieve long-term financial well-being. Therefore, I strongly believe that making financial literacy a core component of the school curriculum is not only necessary but also a profoundly positive development for society as a whole.'",

This situation has more advantages than disadvantages.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a risk of losing focus on long-term educational goals, as hands-on work experience or the lure of travel can shift priorities away from academic ambitions. In addition, a break from academic learning can lead to a loss of study habits and momentum, making it difficult to readjust to academic rigor. For example, a child who graduated with good grades may lose passion for his or her academics. However, I believe this can be overcome if one has strong ambition and decisions from the start.\r\n\r\nTaking a gap year can help individuals clear their heads and gain a better understanding of their career interests and aspirations, leading to more informed decisions regarding their academic and professional pursuits. In addition, traveling can broaden one's horizons, offering exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking, which can enhance creativity and adaptability in future studies. Finally, gaining real-world experience can provide practical skills that are not taught in the classroom, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. As an illustration, a student who volunteers and contributes to the community will certainly be useful in college life later on.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the above statements, I believe that the advantages of postponing college outweigh the disadvantages because it can prepare students well and thoroughly. On the other hand, if some teenagers are able to stay in the direction they set from the beginning and their ambitions, I think the disadvantages will be lost.'",

Discuss both views using personal examples.' \n 'Text': 'The debate between attending live sporting events and watching them from the comfort of home has been a perennial topic among sports enthusiasts. Both options offer distinct advantages, and personal preferences often dictate one's choice. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives using personal examples and evaluate whether this trend constitutes a positive or negative development.\r\n\r\nAttending a live sporting event is an electrifying experience unparalleled by any other. The atmosphere pulsates with excitement as fans unite to support their teams, creating an immersive and unforgettable spectacle. I vividly recall the exhilaration of being in the stadium during a soccer match, surrounded by passionate fans chanting in unison and witnessing the game's drama unfold in real-time. The sense of camaraderie and shared enthusiasm fosters a sense of belonging and community, making live events a truly memorable experience.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, watching sporting events at home offers unparalleled convenience and comfort. With advances in technology, home viewing experiences now rival the thrill of being at the stadium. From the comfort of my living room, I can enjoy high-definition broadcasts, multiple camera angles, and expert commentary, all while lounging in my favorite chair with snacks readily available. Moreover, watching at home eliminates the hassle of travel, parking, and long queues, allowing for a more relaxed and stress-free experience.\r\n\r\nAs for whether this trend is positive or negative, it ultimately depends on individual preferences and circumstances. Live sporting events promote social interaction and community engagement, fostering a sense of unity among fans. However, the rise of home viewing options has democratized access to sports, allowing individuals who may not have the means or opportunity to attend live events to enjoy the spectacle from afar.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both attending live sporting events and watching them at home offer unique benefits and experiences. While I personally enjoy the thrill of being in the stadium, I acknowledge the convenience and accessibility of home viewing options. Ultimately, whether this trend is positive or negative depends on one's perspective and the values they prioritize.'",

I partly disagree due to some challenges that might occur during this access. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several benefits from the Internet revolution in our modern life. Frist thanks to the Internet it is possible to have communication throughout the world which might result in cultural exchange among different societies. Exchanging cultures would help individuals to have a new perspective on the world. Take social media as an example, people from various communities are able to find friends from other countries and cultures. Moreover, global knowledge is another positive point of easy access. For example, if all people have a reliable Internet, they might use it to search for new knowledge and learn them.\r\n\r\nHowever, this revolution might have some downsides as well. The prime concern is about the privacy and security of the users. The more increasing number of users the more risk of increasing rate of cybercrimes. A good illustration of those crimes might be identity thefts that are able to steal our personal information like  passwords and usernames. In addition, another possible issue is that still there are significant disparities in the access and  quality of the Internet in many parts of the world. For instance, in  developing countries, people are dealing with the quality of the Internet. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although there are clear benefits from this revolution based on easy access , there would be some problems that can not be neglected.'",

Some people claim that imposing tolls on roads in heavy traffic can be the best way to reduce their car usage. I strongly support this idea from the environmental and psychological perspectives.\r\n\r\nExamining the former standpoint to begin with, the reduction in amount of traffic on busy roads due to implementing a road toll can be a contributor to mitigating the situation of the present serious air pollution. In fact, there is substantial scientific evidence that backs up the proposition that the energy consumption efficiency of vehicles deteriorates on a road with heavy traffic, which is one of the major factors of pollutants emitted by them. Therefore, if individuals avoid busy roads because of road tolls, they can become more environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nShifting focus to the latter standpoint, people will try to avoid passing through busy streets if a road toll is implemented because they potentially have a psychological tendency to try to avoid even small expenses. For example, many countries have abolished free plastic bags service in shops. Even though each bag costs consumers a little, many of them quit purchasing the bags and instead, they now bring their own eco-bags. I believe that this example can be applicable to the problem of people\u2019s heavy car usage. Hence, if a road poll is not expensive, the psychological impact on car users can be huge.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, although it would be challenging for governments to forbid people from using cars, I am firmly convinced that imposing tolls on busy roads is the most effective strategy to alleviate people\u2019s car usage in terms of the environment and psychology.'",

Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.' \n 'Text': 'Undoubtedly, with resources increasing and technology improving, the boundaries between countries seem lower than before. Therefore, some teachers and parents suggest schools increase subjects that provide international news for students to study. Whereas some people look upon requiring students to study international news as an efficient method to improve students's knowledge, others refer to it as a meaningless idea. As for my perspectives, I am in favour of the former, and the reasons will be elaborated on as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst, studying international news is a way to enrich student's knowledge. That is, students can obtain more knowledge from news, such as local cultures, food, climate and so on. Take me for example, my college teacher had arranged an assignment to let students search foreign news about food and compare it with Taiwanese food. Through that class, I not only learned lots of knowledge about desserts but also learned about their foreign history from them, because desserts were created based on different historical periods. Due to the compulsory assignment, I indeed learned more information, which school textbooks did not have, and started to interested in exploring differences between countries.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Inputting international news can cultivate students' critical thinking. To be more specific, by comparing differences between countries, students will have their own opinions and feedback, which helps teenagers to think and criticize. According to a study conducted by National Taiwan University, inputting more international news to children from 12 to 18 years, the logic and the critical thinking of students are better than those who seldom obtain international information. The result shows that the earlier the children start to read news, the better logical thinking they have.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, based on the aforementioned, reading international news has positive effects on junior students due to acquiring more knowledge and cultivating critical thinking.'",

What are advantages and disadvantages of this ?\u201d' \n 'Text': 'Having more than one job has turned into a common practice in many societies. Also, the majority of individuals tend to change their jobs at different milestones of their lives. Although  developing this work pattern may lead to an active lifestyle   as well as financial prosperity , however, the destructive effects of this issue on having a professional career should not be ignored.\r\n\r\nTaking an active life approach into account, it is obvious that involving in two or more jobs means a higher level of income. Consequently, an individual can have different hobby choices and can  participate in various types of entertainment; this issue avoids a sedentary lifestyle and in the long run we witness of shaping a happy characteristic with less tension and stress.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this subject should not be neglected that engaging in more careers simultaneously, may result in fatigue.

So, the only result is saving money and different types of diseases related to extra work and fewer breaks.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, creating a balanced work-life trend is  an essential factor to have a successful personality.

Other people think there are benefits if a society has more elderly people.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do the advantages of having an aging population outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Recently there has been an argument going on among notions regarding whether an upward trend of having aged or old people is a good sign for society or not. Some believe that this can result in various drawbacks, while others hold the belief that these individuals might be beneficial for a community in some ways. Personally, I am a firm believer that the disadvantages of this statement outweigh its benefits in a variety of aspects. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, by having a majority of elders, society has to provide various hospitals and caring places in order to take care of these groups of people in many aspects such as their medications as well as their mental health. This statement would become an issue in the long run, which can make governments spend most of the money coming from taxes to be spent on providing health care places. In other words, there would be no rooms left for other facilities like schools for children or workplaces. In addition to that, these hospitals require a vast majority of doctors and staff to work, which may be a concerning issue for governments to provide a proper number of professionals in this field. \r\n\r\nWhile elders can be beneficial to adolescents regarding their life and work experience, they would not be eligible to work since they require care and help 24/7, which can become problematic. Furthermore, if the number of ageing individuals increases, societies will face a lack of workforce. Lack of a proper workforce will put a country in serious danger. For instance, in China, the number of elders is growing rapidly each year due to their large population. Therefore, this country is facing difficulties in their working industry, and as a result of that, youngsters have to work more than usual to fully satisfy the needs of companies, which makes them tired and can not work efficiently. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that the growth in the ageing population might not be a good sign for communities, since this group of people are now retired and need great help, which can cause serious problems for a country.'",

Of course, there are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem. in this essay, I will explain it in details.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, two main factors are to blame for increasing the crimes. Firstly, lack of suitable education. It is clear that there is a positive correlation between education and crime.The number of crimes in countries with high-quality  education systems is much less than the countries with poor education systems.Secondly, Lack of Job opportunities could be another reason for crime increasing. When people do not have a proper job that can make money and occupy their time efficiently , they will start to earn money in  illegal ways  which causes increased mass.For Example, the number of robberies in a poor country with a high rate of unemployment is much more than in the countries which have a good job market.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways that can be dealt with this problem, but I believe that the government's role is very important. In the first step, governments should try to improve the education system and provide some facilities so that primary education be free for all citizens. They also should review the school's curricula and carry out some reforms in the curriculum content of schools with the aim of acquaintance of students with the drawbacks of delinquency. the second useful step could be trying to provide more jobs and improve the job market in order to reduce the number of jobless population. For instance, facilitating the running of factories and huge stores in densely populated areas  leads to hiring a large group of residents.\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion, The number of violations and crimes is growing for several reasons such as lack of a proper education system or high rate of unemployment which  require the participation of the government to create conditions for improving the education system and labour market situation.'",

I think it depends on the type of work and this development could be positive for some occupations but not for all positions.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some jobs do not need physical participation because need mental processes so by reforming technology it is easier to work from a distance area, as a result, it is an advantageous method . Subsequently, this reduces in physical existence of office locations, and the size of relevant buildings will decrease so the company can save more money because they do not need specious places. Additionally, when employees do not go to workplaces the amount of commuters will reduce and it can upgrade environmental quality gradually . For example, during the pandemic governments introduced websites  for the population to respond to their needs, staff were behind their computers and they did it so effortlessly, communicating with citizens and solving their problems  during that period in a large number of capital cities air quality increased dramatically.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some positions are sensitive and they need physical treatments because this may lead that community to uncontrollable consequences and being far away from their place can be a risky activity. For example, judges and lawyers are in very sensitive locations and they might be targeted by cyber-attacks during their online courts so being active in face-to-face locations will eliminate this risk and will not be easily distributed by foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, In my opinion, upgrading methods of doing occupations is a good development,however , just for low-risk levels because it reduces emissions and money spent but for high-risk levels, it will be better to keep the classical way to prevent unwanted dangers.'",

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, choosing from single-sex and multi-sex schools has become increasingly popular in most nations. While some parents argue that studying with peers of the same gender is the preferable option, others prefer multi-gender peers as they provide different life skills than single-sex schools. In my view, I agree with the statement that children go to co-educational institutions because youths can gain various experiences and knowledge and I will demonstrate why mixed-sexual schools are the best in this essay.\r\n\r\nAs education is considered an important integral part of bringing up our next generation, the first thing that has to be done by parents is which schools they send their children whether it will be single-gender or mixed ones. There are more advantages if people choose multi-sex schools than other ones. Because it provides an opportunity to interact and deal with children who are in a different sexual category. For example, knowing and observing the male attitudes and behaviours while learning in class will help a female student gain social skills with men, which means that they are further used to overcoming and managing challenges in their own family and their careers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the benefit mentioned above, another advantage why I prefer co-educational places is that they foster a sense of biological psychological identities between females and males. As a result in children acknowledging and understanding biological characteristics, they are able to distinguish strengths and weaknesses in both physical and intellectual levels. For example, a woman cannot lift a heavy item because their body is not designed to perform such heavy physical work as miners, for instance, while men master it. Instead, they have a reproduction ability and a better quality of caring and loving ones. In other words, men cannot give birth and do not have much stamina in pain compared to women. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, today, education institutions offer programs that specialize in gender, such as single-sexual and mixed genders. Although some people think single-sexual schools are better, others believe that mixed-gender schools because they think that their children can obtain various experiences and skills such as sexual differentiation and the capacities of one of each gender, which I agree with.'",

However, this problem can be tackled by organizing appealing activities.\r\n\r\n     One of the significant reasons why fewer people prefer walking is that some technological applications which supply travelling, including escalators and lifts are very prevalent in public places. These amenities help people to move higher easily and without any physical activities despite of staying up on their feet. It is evident that there are stairs which are created for those who want to walk as much as possible, but few people prefer walking up stairs rather than using lifts. Moreover, as people\u2019s living standards are developing, they are more likely to go to an array of sports facilities such as yoga and gym which are more interesting and efficient for improving a health level than taking a stroll.\r\n\r\n    In order to encourage individuals to do more walking than they did, various interesting methods can be implemented to address the problem. People can be encouraged by art and paintings. For instance, nowadays, the government is trying to add more spectacular paintings on the walls of stairs and streets to get more people active daily. In addition, there are some applications which give money to people for the number of their footsteps. This is the better option for those who want to engage in physical activities.\r\n\r\n   In conclusion, a growing number of people dislike walking for several reasons and this problem can be addressed with some measures suggested.'",

From my perspective, however, the benefits of space search far outweigh its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOne primary reason is the development of technology. Many cutting-edge technology was invented in the space inspection stage at first. The relevant authorities put tremendous funds into the improvement of space technology and most of those state-of-the-art space technologies would eventually be used by normal people. For instance, the Internet was initially invented for the purpose of communicating with space crafts and space stations. However, after several years of improvement, this technology was finally utilized by everyone on their personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some opponents of space exploration stated that instead of spending on this, the government should focus on upgrading the infrastructure. If the government puts too much money into the improvement of space technology, there will be no ample funds to renovate some basic facilities. Nonetheless, investment in space technology not only has a remarkable impact on space exploration but also establishes the reputation of the countries. Therefore, many international companies might want to invest in the industry in this area. This will give those states more funding to build infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I firmly believe that it is worth it to invest the space exploration.

In my opinion, there are lots of benefits to begin for studying  foreign languages in primary school rather than starting in secondary school.\r\n\r\nRegarding good timing,beginning to learn a foreign language in a primary academy is much better than after the age. One of the benefits for young students who initially studied in this primary school period is that most young people could effectively learn  new things, compared to the older ones. They also have less content requiring to focus on lessons compared to the fields in secondary academies such as math and science. Moreover, it is a golden period for these youth to learn new things and they are capable of getting much input without any concerns in kids' lives. For example, the young could concentrate on the subjects without helping their parents do household chores because of being too young. \r\n\r\nEven though there are a plethora of advantages to studying earlier, there is a drawback to this issue concerning kids' parents. It significantly costs for English or foreign programs compared to the standard. For example, the price for a normal course may be around $2,000 a term, while the parents might need to pay double or triple times for the English plan depending on pricing for each institute. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the pros noticeably outweigh the cons with regards to the best learning age,which they are less concerned with and the golden youth in that time.

We form quick judgments about others upon meeting them, and these initial evaluations can significantly impact our decisions and relationships. While this tendency serves a purpose in some situations, it can also lead to misinterpretations in others.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions hold considerable weight in professional settings, particularly during job interviews. Employers often base their initial assessment of a candidate on factors like appearance, body language, and communication skills. In fast-paced recruitment processes, a positive first impression can be crucial for securing a desired position, especially in roles that involve public interaction like sales or customer service. Here, a confident demeanor and professional presentation can create a lasting positive memory for the interviewer.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on first impressions can be detrimental when forming personal connections. Cultural differences, clothing choices, and even momentary behavior can create misleading judgments.  For example, one might encounter someone whose attire seems unconventional, leading to an initial impression of a lack of experience or professionalism. This perception, as my husband discovered during a chance encounter on a train, could be entirely inaccurate. After striking up a conversation, he learned the seemingly unassuming individual was a distinguished military officer in his home country.

I disagree with this policy because some people are not prepared to do this kind of training and some of them do not have the required skills.\r\n\r\nTo begin, the main problem is the fact of forcing anyone around 18 years old to attend the Armed Forces. Some people perhaps do not like this type of service or sometimes do have not the proper physical abilities. As a result, these people will become bad soldiers and others cannot be selected. \r\n\r\nFor example, in Brazil, when a boy complete 18 years old, he has to apply for compulsory military service. The majors are dismissed, by chance, due to the limitation of vacations. So, some people more prepared to do this service cannot attend, whereas others not prepared can be chosen. Moreover, this period of working for the Armed Forces can difficult for further studies to enrol on a university. Considering that the usual time for this compulsory job is around 1 year, people have to wait this time to apply for tertiary education. As a consequence, these young men will be late to attend university and work in the future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some benefits to adopting this system, especially in developing countries where there are few options for further education. So, the military service can be an opportunity for poor people to begin a career. Additionally, military service is a good way to make new friends and learn some values such as honour, discipline, and responsibility.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe that this sort of service should be optional.

Discuss both views and also give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary world, individuals often face a choice between whether it is essential to give homework to the students as it plays a vital role in their academics or it is not necessary. This trend has sparked controversial opinions with advocates and critics supporting it with valid arguments. This essay will analyze both sides and will subsequently lead to a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary extrapolation to support the view that homework is important because it helps the tutees to revise their class work which is helpful to them to score better in their examinations. Some learners have a weak memory, they easily forget what was taught in class, but when they study that once again they can understand and remember those materials for a longer period. Furthermore, when juveniles are asked to study from home, this helps to build a strong relationship between parents and their kids because in most cases, guardians indulge with their children to assist them in their studies, accordingly, they can spend more quality time together.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, homework increases the stress level of teenagers because they already spend 9-10 hours in school with books, if they have to follow the same schedule twice a day then they get restless and their physical and mental growth is affected relentlessly and the repercussions are disruptive as due to the pressure of studies scholar try to avoid attending classes. Moreover, more homework leaves children with no time to play with their friends and they are stuck in the house. They can not live a healthy life due to the pressurized environment.\r\n\r\nAlthough providing homework to kids has some harmful effects on them its benefits outweigh its drawbacks because it is a boom for weak learners along with this it reduces the generation gap in society. Therefore, I agree with the matrimonial that homework plays a major role in education.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, giving revision work to children has a lot of pros for them, however, its cons should not be overlooked either. Rendering homework to school students has advantages but their physical and mental growth should be considered carefully.'",

It is my contention that depending on the countries' background, the payback of arranging such massive sports organizations can vary significantly. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, in the contemporary world, a majority of countries aspire to be able to host an international athletics tournament with a whim to attract global attention to their countries. To exemplify this statement, economically advantageous countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were competing for a right to hold the next FIFA World Football Cup, to showcase their commitment towards elevated modernity, infrastructural development and human rights. Furthermore, since these international activities are being pursued by millions of followers and fans from all across the world, the host countries will have a chance to advertise the beauty of their country by promoting their cultural and societal norms. Consequently, these countries begin to turn into tourist hubs in the following years, thus, generating a considerable amount of  revenue. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side,  history is full of occasions when countries with ambitious plans and monetary resources that used to be conceived as infinite were bankrupted and underwent a massive devaluation due to the massive failures of their plans to curry favour with the international communities. One such example  occurred in 2008, when the Greek government had to terminate the World Olympic Games, attributable to a financial crisis caused by exorbitant purchases and budget overruns prior to this event. Greece's economy has not yet thoroughly recovered from this loss, resulting in residents losing their jobs and houses.  Moreover, presently, a majority of oil-rich countries competing with each other to win the game-host awards just in an attempt to create a positive portrayal representing the true colours of their countries.

While some people believe that many other environmental problems are in an emergency to deal with.My stance is that biodiversity imbalance is not the most difficult problem in the world and the more important problems such as air pollution are an immediate provision.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is evidence suggesting how harmful the disappearance of several plants and animals is negative impacted to the environment. This can be seen in the extinction of  natural habitats and many animal species due to deforestation and poaching, resulting in the disruption of the balance of nature and destabilization of ecosystems. Such problems, however, are caused by maladroit governments that either overlook the importance of the environment or the repercussions of their inaction because of a thriving economy.Thus, the environment could still be protected if the government posed more strict regulations such as hefty fines, sentenced individuals who break the laws to jail and encouraged organizations and citizens to raise funds to open zoos to preserve rare animals or plant more trees.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that air pollution in cities is the most urgent threat all over the world. It might be caused by vehicle emissions and industrial activities. For example, traffic congestion and the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles release pollutants such as carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. In addition, the process of manufacture and the activity of industry emit pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can,hence, harm the degradation of the environment ,causing climate change.This is particularly true in the case of  today\u2019s earth where we suffer from various tremendous disasters such as floods, tsunamis, earthquakes and droughts due to climate changes, directly affecting human life.These problems are way far too earnest because  governments can not forbid people from transport and halt manufacturing activities cause it will negatively affect the development of the world economy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the urgency of solving the loss of animals and plants is to protect the  world\u2019s biodiversity, however, air pollution is more necessary for governments to tackle and to find solutions since it affects human life.'",

I unequivocally agree with this statement because classroom teaching fosters problem-solving skills in pupils , and it is an active reception of content.\r\n\r\nThe first reason for my agreement is that  technology-based teaching does not enable offspring to build critical thinking as traditional teaching methods not only develop critical skills but also build problem-solving skills in juveniles. This is because learning in a classroom setting enables juveniles to conquer a number of problems at a time and students try to find solutions to these problems in a short while under the guidance of mentors which is not possible in the case of the internet and television resources. For instance,  there is an artificial intelligence teacher launched in the market, which plays a significant role in explaining the basic concept of studies to pupils, however, in case offspring have doubts about studies this invention is unable to serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nA further reason is that curriculum-based learning involves active delivery of content by a teacher which is in other cases delivered passively where there is no face-to-face interaction at all. It is a well-known fact that giving lessons at schools and colleges is only possible with the help of teachers because there is not any gizmo which replaces them. Howbeit, online sources at alma mater deliver lectures in a passive mode which is not able to provide them feedback when they are asking for something. For example, the XYZ YouTube channel provides mathematics coaching to students, and there are various  numerical illustrations to guide them in solving issues. On the other hand, when offspring initiate to sort out problems on their own, they face complications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the opinion that the classroom environment assists students to learn in a better and greater way as compared than taking guidance from television and the Internet because developing a skill to solve hurdles is only possible with strict teacher guidance and one can actively receive  content without any obstruction.'",

Personally, I completely agree with the first statement, and in this essay, I will demonstrate that point of view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, mobile phones are an excellent resource for learning for children. For instance, Google, Youtube, or learning apps are used to search for information or learn new languages, which support skill development and enhance knowledge. Moreover, cell phones can be a source of entertainment after class. For example, young students play games or listen to music during break time. It helps them relax comfortably, and they can absorb lessons better. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, children should be prohibited from using mobile devices because it wastes a huge amount of time, and leads to electronic devices (such as smartphones, or tablets, etc.) becoming addicted. Reliance on electronic devices makes it difficult for them to focus on schoolwork, and social isolation, and reduces physical activity. As a result, it decreases their productivity. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to computers or smartphones brings about healthy effects. For example, it leads to sleep disruption, eye diseases, or mental health. Therefore, it affects family finances and imposes a burden on society. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, even though using phones in class can help our young children improve their knowledge as well as provide entertainment, there are harmful effects on children's physical and mental health.

However, in some other cities, bicycles are replacing cars. \r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for these two developments? \r\n\r\nIn your opinion, which one better?' \n 'Text': 'In modern days, there has been an increasing number of cars replacing bicycles in some cities due to time-saving, while cars also make way for cycles, which derives from environmental protection. This writer strongly claims that the cars\u2019 replacement is a positive status quo because of the growth of public health.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognized that saving time is a focal reason for people choosing to drive cars rather than riding bicycles. This is because time is invaluable for everyone and can not be reversed if it flows out. In addition, the speed of the cars is faster than cycles in most situations, with the exception of floods or traffic congestion. As a result, dwellers\u2019 decisions on cars will always be more than bicycles in recent communities worldwide. Take the USA as a pertinent example, where the majority of citizens commute to work or study by car with the purpose of punctuality and it is just a small group of people ride cycles on the roads, especially the elderly.\r\n\r\nIt must also be acknowledged that the awareness of ecosystem protection is the motivation for bicycles to become a priority in many nations. In other words, riding bicycles does not release any harmful substances like cars, which burn fossil fuels and put an immense amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere, leading to the greenhouse effect. For this reason, many cities just allow citizens to ride their cycles for most of the aim in order to go green.\r\n\r\nThis writer\u2019s perspective on this global phenomenon is that the replacement of cars with bicycles is an effective way to enhance public well-being. This is especially so if riding a bicycle is identical to doing regular exercises which can assist people to improve their health status. Besides that, the more often people ride bicycles, the longer life expectancy they get. Japan is a prime example, where not only adults and children ride bicycles for working or studying, but the elderly still use bicycles as exercises for the general target of public health enhancement.\r\n\r\nThus, the use of cars can bring the benefits of saving time, whereas the developing circumstance of bicycles has a positive influence on the environment.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'These days, shopping bags made from plastic have caused controversy in society. Some people believe plastic bags should be banned because they harm the environment such as water and soil. I strongly agree with that opinion and I believe that society should start considering replacing plastic bags with other environmentally friendly bags in order to lessen the negative impact made by plastic bags.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, much research has shown that plastic bags have a lot of disadvantages for the environment. A recent case found by researchers is there are a lot of plastic bags floating in the sea and getting stuck in turtle fins. That could bother the turtle activities. Moreover, researchers obtained that there are several cases of plastic bags eaten by turtles because they are misrecognized as jellyfish. This would seriously harm the turtle's life and could make the turtle become an extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a lot of people have started a movement of change in order to shift the use of plastic bags. For example, in Indonesia, a well-known mini market named Alfamart has banned plastic bags in order to support this movement. Customers are required to bring their own bags to the shop, even if they forget to bring them, Alfamart will not give the plastic bags to them so they have to bring their groceries by hand. Although it is done only in Alfamart, there are big chance that this movement could be done by bigger organizations and become globally adopted by people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say that banning plastic bags nationally is a good idea and I strongly agree with that, but this must be supported by organizations and the government so people are doing it because of the rules.'",

People focus on unreal someone and push aside real relationships.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Social networking through which we get scammed by meeting on the internet peers, and friends.  At the start, they access to have the illegitimate purpose to sheer people. Very dangerous directly to believe a stranger. It might occur in relentless incidents and reckless results. It's very difficult to classify who is a nice person or a harmful person that only briefly met.

That is why many companies require robots in their working chains to improve productivity and less human-heavy physical activities involved. This development can lead to a positive impact on society due to more work being done to replace the heavy work. Instead of putting workers in unemployment due to robots taking their place, it creates more tasks to control these machines which results in more jobs.

First, professional hackers from other countries can easily break into the system or people's bank accounts and steal their large sums of money in a split second.

People who come from other countries have been moved to more developed countries because of raising their well-being including job opportunities and welfare. However, they may not know their neighbours living nearby area. This essay will describe the main problems and solutions regarding this current situation.\r\n\r\nThere are two main roots causing the population not to know each other even though they live  next door. Firstly, individuals absolutely have their own personalities we do not know what they like or dislike. For instance, some are introverts who do not like to talk with strangers and prefer staying home with themselves or their family to going out. They might not want to participate with others if not necessary. Secondly, particularly in huge cities like New York or Sydney, most of the population who live in the city or work in that area are likely to have a similar lifestyle. For example, being in a rush hour  every morning and evening after work. They might take a long time to commute between their  workplace and home. Furthermore, they need to spare time to avoid any accident in rush hour such as delayed public transportation, rain or a lot of traffic jams on some days. Those may lead them to be  productive person in every day because they need to compete with timing. So this probably causes them  not to want to know their neighbours anymore due to spending too much time with their lifestyle in the big city  each day. \r\n\r\nWith regard to this situation, there will be a solution relieving. Having some activities together may be another way  to solve them. Particularly, in the same building or village, all the tenants could come to join some activities which there should be someone or an organization held  for their community. For example, there probably are Christmas parties for their individuals. There occasionally is a meeting for any updates about their community as well. These might assist them to know each other on purpose.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, individuals living in a large city may not know their neighbours because of their lifestyles each day and personalities from different backgrounds. However, they could be relieved by participating in some activities where there are plenty of chances to know others more easily.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is true that the use of mobile phones and computers is increasing.Therefore, there exists a debate about whether the tendency weakens people's ability to communicate face-to-face or not.From my perspective, I am inclined to stand with the proponents as people are getting used to talking online which influences their communication skills when in different contexts.\r\n\r\nInitially,one of the main arguments in favour of the opinion is that there is a phenomenon that some individuals have different behaviours between  reality and online. As people prefer to communicate on phones or computers, they are familiar with talking without eye contact which can be impolite when talking face-to-face. Especially for young people who rely heavily on mobile phones and computers, their communication abilities are not properly practised which may lead to difficulties in building up relationships and even affect their future development. According to the aforementioned, the tendency indeed contributes to some counterproductive outcomes.\r\n\r\n At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who focus too much on mobile phones and computers may lose their interest or confidence in real contacts. For example, there are people who are talkative on the Internet but silent in their real lives because they may  lack  confidence when facing crowds. To make situations worse, they may finally hide behind screens since they can talk with ease in such conditions. Hence, the use of mobile phones and computers not only provides new media for communication but also weakens individuals\u2019 abilities to communicate in person to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, despite the fact that the common use of mobile phones and computers is inevitable as technology develops, the importance of communication skills cannot be ignored.Therefore, users should spend more time communicating face-to-face so as to make improvements.'",

I completely agree with this, and I think that the benefits of learning a new language in elementary school will be much greater than in middle school.\r\n\r\nChildren in the second seven years of life have higher learning power compared to the third seven years. Elementary students have incredible ability and skill at learning new skills and their concentration power is much higher. On the other hand, learning at a young age is more durable and changes children's way of thinking, which will have a very positive effect on their lives in the future. Because children in elementary school face fewer puberty problems and experience fewer challenges, they can devote more time to education.\r\n\r\nLearning at a young age can also have disadvantages. It may make the student feel inadequate or cause the student to feel a lot of pressure from learning a new language, which makes her less interested in the new language. These days, children are bombarded with leisure time classes, which may make them not have a happy childhood.\r\n\r\nAlthough learning at a young age has its disadvantages, in today's world, knowing a new language is not a choice, but a compulsion, and serious decisions should be made from an early age.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The discourse surrounding the pivotal role of parents versus schools in molding children into conscientious members of society sparks considerable debate. While some contend that parents should shoulder this responsibility, others advocate for schools as the optimal setting for such education. Both perspectives possess merits, but a nuanced analysis is essential to discern the efficacy of each in fostering the development of young individuals.\r\n\r\nParents stand as the primary influencers and nurturers during a child's formative years. Within the familial domain, values, ethics, and morals are not just taught but ingrained through daily interactions and familial dynamics. Observing parental conduct instills virtues like empathy, respect, and social adeptness in children. Additionally, the familial milieu fosters a sense of accountability and responsibility, integral traits for societal integration and contribution.\r\n\r\nContrarily, educational institutions serve as structured environments where children spend a significant portion of their developmental journey. Schools offer a comprehensive framework, encompassing academic pursuits alongside moral and social education. Through tailored programs like citizenship classes and community service initiatives, students are nurtured in qualities such as teamwork, leadership, and civic responsibility. Thus, schools serve as incubators for well-rounded individuals primed for societal engagement.\r\n\r\nWhile parents and schools play indispensable roles in shaping societal ethos, the synergy between these spheres is paramount. Parents lay the groundwork by imparting fundamental values, subsequently augmented and reinforced by the educational apparatus. Collaborative efforts between familial and institutional influences ensure a holistic approach to character development, fostering individuals who seamlessly integrate into society's fabric.\r\n\r\nIn summation, the debate regarding parental versus institutional influence in shaping societal contributors necessitates recognition of their symbiotic relationship. Both entities are instrumental in sculpting the moral and social compass of future generations.

        "input": "'Question': 'Some students work while studying. This often results in lacking time for education and constantly feeling under pressure.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think are the causes of this?\r\n\r\nWhat solutions can you suggest?' \n 'Text': 'In today's competitive academic environment, many students find themselves having to balance work commitments with their studies. This juggling act often leads to a lack of time for education and a constant feeling of pressure. This essay will explore the primary causes of students working while studying and propose effective solutions to mitigate these challenges.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons students work while studying is the financial burden associated with higher education. Tuition fees, accommodation costs, and other expenses compel many students to seek part-time employment to make ends meet. Consequently, they end up dedicating a significant portion of their time and energy to work, leaving them with less time for studying. Additionally, societal pressures and expectations for young individuals to become financially independent further exacerbate this issue. For example, students from low-income backgrounds may feel compelled to work to support their families or achieve social mobility.\r\n\r\nTo address this dilemma, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, educational institutions can offer more financial aid and scholarships to reduce the financial burden on students. This can alleviate the need for students to work extensively and allow them to focus more on their studies. Moreover, creating flexible class schedules and offering online courses can provide students with the opportunity to manage their time more effectively. Encouraging employers to offer flexible working hours or internships related to students\u2019 fields of study can also help in striking a balance between work and education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the pressures and time constraints faced by students working while studying are often rooted in financial constraints and societal expectations. By implementing solutions such as increased financial aid, flexible class schedules, and relevant work opportunities, we can empower students to fulfill their academic potential without compromising their well-being. Ultimately, it is essential for stakeholders in the education sector to collaborate and create a supportive environment that enables students to thrive academically while fulfilling their work obligations.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'As countries develop, their populations tend to live individually or in small family units. What are the causes of this trend and what are the effects on society\uff1f' \n 'Text': 'There is a growing tendency to live individually or in small family units as countries develop. From my perspective, the situation may be caused by the change in the social attitude towards family and it may result in high pressure on the ageing care system in society.\r\n\r\nInitially, one of the main changes in the public attitude towards family is that people tend to have high life qualities which can be difficult for big families in general. People who live alone may think living with others will bring about burdens such as higher expenditures and conflicts in relationships. As for those who have small family units, they are prone to provide more resources to their descendants as the distribution can be divvied up with only several family members and they are likely to have relatively sufficient care than those in big families. Hence, individuals who are concerned about life quality possibly live in small family units or individually.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the trend will enhance the demand for the social ageing nursing system due to the unbalanced proportion between the elderly and the prime-age population. As there are more and more seniors living alone, there is a high possibility that they may need social welfare to support their nursing. Even if they have descendants, the government may have to support those who have to take care of their parents and children in the meantime.Because of small family units, individuals do not have enough family backup which means their family burdens are heavier than those who are brought up in big families since they have more family members to share the responsibility. Therefore, the situation indeed will raise the governmental burden on ageing nursing.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, crowds prefer to live alone or in small family units due to life quality concerns.However, it will generate rising demands for nursing care systems in society.Thus, the government should implement some strategies to prepare for future requirements according to the growing tendency.'",

This variation gives them a chance to work freely and earn more money than working at companies. However, it has its own drawbacks such as working longer hours should be highlighted in this circumstance. \r\n\r\nIt is evident that  flexibility is the most appealing for those who choose to work for themselves. This choice allows them to manage their work and life balance which is what most people prefer. Additionally, in this fast-growing technological era, there are many people earning more money from online businesses compared to corporate jobs. As a result, some individuals choose to work for themselves and prefer to use their competitive skills to earn enough money. For example, there are many yoga teachers organizing online classes on the Internet and earning huge amounts of money while they are  staying at their homes. This revenue is much higher than traditional yoga teachers working at physical training courses. \r\n\r\n On the other hand,  there are evident drawbacks and self-employment is not as easy as it looks. Because  business management and operational tasks are extremely heavy for a single person. In order to grow their business steadily , almost most entrepreneurs do their all tasks themselves such as marketing advertisement, accounting, and cleaner as well. Especially, in the first five years, most business owners have to work without a day off. Not only does it require  hard work, but it also makes it stressful. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the possibilities of balancing work and life and managing their own time are the main reasons why people choose to be self-employed. However, due to the fact that most new business owner need to work longer hours  it requires a lot of effort and energy to develop their business successfully.'",

Do you think the advantages of multi-cultural societies outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'There are multi-cultural people who socialize and live together in some places. I believe that the advantages outweigh its disadvantages. This essay will discuss why living in a multi-national society is better. \r\n\r\nFirstly, living and working with other countries people can enhance understanding of diverse cultural backgrounds. These benefits broaden our horizons to see others, which is extremely useful in our daily activities. For instance, people living in multicultural countries, such as Australia and Canada, can be successful in any social sector because they more know about diverse cultures compared to others. This is because they experienced many people from all over the world at their workplaces or schools. \r\n\r\nSecondly, a multicultural society enhances a country's economic perspective. This is because parents and relatives visit  their child or friend as a tourist from overseas, which is huge revenue to the country. Not only, does tourism benefit  the country, but also education is the main  sector of the economy. For example, most foreigners pursue higher degrees at university in multi-cultural countries, which is expensive and would be the main revenue of the country's GDP. On the other hand, however, studying and working abroad in multicultural countries can have some disadvantages, such as high life expenses and high tuition fees are high, I believe that this can be overcome as long as people have jobs. These developed countries always offer higher salaries than other countries, therefore, many people prefer to live in those well-developed countries. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe that living in a multicultural country is a better idea, and the benefits outweigh its drawbacks. Because people who live in these countries usually have broad minds and can be successful in any sector. Additionally, this multi-cultural society can bring a lot of money to the country because of the educational sector. While this perspective has some drawbacks, people can handle them easily if they have a job.'",

Some individuals benefit from migrating from their homeland to a new country to embrace better career opportunities, live a different lifestyle or \r\n\r\nfor quality of life. These are the lead reasons why most of the immigrants chose countries such as Australia and New Zealand to live, for example.

Many parents introduce their children to television as a learning source. I completely agree with the fact that books can never be replaced by television as a learning tool. This essay will provide relevant examples and a conclusion to support my views.\r\n\r\nFirstly, books are made for only one purpose and that is education. Children are introduced to  books in their early stage of life because no matter where they study  either schools, colleges or universities, they will find books everywhere. Books are irreplaceable and there is no feel without books if someone is learning on television. For example, children learning alphabet on television might not pay attention to it. On the other side, if they are learning alphabet from  books, they are more likely to concentrate on that.\r\n\r\nHowever, television might be a good source if children want to learn poems or maths which requires some sort of imagination. It is not a good idea to introduce television to  children in their early stage otherwise, they won't be able to understand the books. Television can't generate that atmosphere or feel which is generated by the books. For example, if a child is reading something in a book, he / she might get that feeling that can't be experienced on television.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think television is a good source of  entertainment which should not be used as a learning tool for children. Books are called human's best friends and the quality of education that children get from  books is way too high as compared to television.'",

It is my contention that whilst the tourism sector is responsible for the development of countries, it comes along with drawbacks such as pollution, high migration and steep price increases in local markets, making it affordable and leaving an unviable option for the ingenious people.  \r\n\r\nAs a major benefit, undoubtedly, the tourism sector plays a crucial role in the economies of many countries like Turkey, France and the UAE. The surge in tourist numbers creates additional monetary value at  tourist destinations. For example,  tourism alone accounts for 20% of Turkey's entire economy, allowing them to divert these resources to the advancement of other sectors that  fell behind. In order to increase the number of visitors, tourist countries rigorously invest to develop their existing infrastructure as well as enhance the living conditions of their employees. Furthermore, tourism promotes cultural exchange, allowing both visitors and hosts to learn about and appreciate different customs, traditions and ways of life. Resultantly, this mutual comprehension can foster global  connections and goodwill.\r\n\r\nDespite these benefits aforementioned above, tourism can also have adverse effects. First of all, as a direct result of tourism, each year many forests, parks and the entire flora and fauna are being destroyed by the increasing number of tourists. Moreover, due to the increased demand in the peak seasons, regions can be overwhelmed, falling short of accommodating tourists. Bearing in mind the influence of seasonality factor on the local markets, especially real-estate prices have surged drastically, compelling natives to cope with these difficulties. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while tourism offers a potential avenue for economic growth and cultural interaction, the scope of its drawbacks is expanding to a critical point, leading to a significant increase in local markets and environmental pollution.'",

The recent public debates revolved around whether individuals should have an extraordinary talent for having many followers or not need to have it. While some argue that unique skills are important for that, I firmly believe that people might get fame by psychological triggers or just because they have provocative behavior and pretend to be well-known and rich. In this essay, I will elaborate on these points of view.\r\n\r\nSince the Internet appeared, social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Tik Tok were created and spread around the world. Due to these instruments, famous seekers can use dishonest methods and triggers to grab the audience\u2019s attention. For example, a recent study says that bloggers on Instagram in Eastern Europe offer special courses that are promised after passing which you can become incredibly rich. During these courses, bloggers gain an audience and earn big money.\r\n\r\nOne more thing that can attract the public is the provocation and entertainment of the population. They can wait for your posts or stories as a live serial. For example, the TV Show \u00abKeeping up with Kardashians\u00bb in the United States. The family started their career without any talent just using a frame-up which finally brought them success. Many millions have been watching this TV show all over 20 years.

Some people claim that there is a hope to improve the environment; moreover, authors and enterprises are the subjects that should be responsible. However, I firmly disagree with this statement and this essay will try to examine the reasons.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, although governments and tremendous companies play a vital role in maintaining  environmental sustainability, inhabitants should be involved in this trend. There are many regulations and campaigns that have been made by the authors but they still do not give any improvement because people do not obey them. For instance, in Indonesia, there are  plenty number of campaigns that can influence people to reduce plastic usage. However, people still use plastic in many parts of their activities, such as using cloth bags instead of plastic bags when they are shopping. Obviously, there are numerous people who still are not aware of the environment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, many large companies do not obey the regulations. Nowadays, the governments have a high focus on product packages, therefore, they should use eco-friendly materials in their products, particularly the packages. Despite many strict regulations with fines, there are many companies that avoid making it happen due to it will be increased cost of production. Eventually, people should play their role by avoiding buying their products and boycotting them. So, it will affect their profit and tend to obey the governments.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is true that the government and larger companies should take action to improve the environment. However, the community should be involved in this trend in order to public influence the realization of campaigns and drive enterprises to obey the regulation.'",

In my opinion, the lack of words allows music to evoke the same emotion, as well as the special instruments enable people to learn about other cultures, although the stories behind music may remind people of awful memories.\r\n\r\nMusic shows emotions and thoughts through its tune, so civilians from different cultures and ages can have similar feelings about it. The main cause of misunderstanding is that it is difficult to interpret things that came from another area, because people can not have a good grasp of other literature. But music does not have this problem--it illustrates itself by tune! So everyone who listens to it can have the same thought. For instance, the Fate Symphony can inspire numerous citizens, whether they are from England or India. If people have the same feelings, surely they will be brought together.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of music is it gives people chances to look closely at other cultures and finally, they will be familiar with each other and get together. Nearly every culture has its unique instruments and these instruments can also contribute to touching music. If one is fascinated by the music which is created by a special instrument, he/she is likely to make an effort to learn more about this instrument, and then one will know more things about the instrument and its hometown's culture. This will lead to a decrease in misunderstanding and bring people together.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, music may be responsible for some anger. As a matter of fact, music is always produced by something that can give inspiration to musicians. For example, a song may be created to celebrate the win of a war. However, the one who comes from British will not be satisfied with the song which aims to show off the win of France, and vice versa. He/she may be angry with this and the crack between them will be deeper.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, music may make some people angry, however, it can allow people of different cultures and ages to think the similar things and gain insight into other countries.'",

Such experiences encourage personal growth and a reassessment of life's direction, thereby improving their overall quality of life.\r\n\r\nConversely, some argue that allowing children to make their own choices can foster selfishness.

To tackle this problem, it is assumed that authorities should fund the public transport system. Also, reducing its charge could result in more usage of public transport among people.\r\n\r\nNowadays, individuals tend to prefer owning private transportation rather than utilizing public transportation. Thus, the reason behind it is comfort. Using a vehicle with plenty of people means that it is crowded and uncomfortable. In addition, the customers need to follow to timetable which cannot get along with everyone's schedule. However, having a private car or bike would save time and offer more freedom to individuals. In some cases, people must need a car because they have children or have to stop at a number of locations daily. For example, if you have kids, you must drop off them first at their school or kindergarten. Nevertheless, there are numerous choices such as bikes, scooters and so on which create zero contamination in the environment. As a result, governments investing in public transport could have lower consequences as it was expected to be, even though, cars can pollute areas more, for some individuals it is mandatory. Nonetheless, others can still own private vehicles, but not contaminate  nature.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is true that if public transport systems improve, it would attract much more passengers. Therefore, decreasing the fee of public transportation would offer reasonable prices for those who cannot afford their own private vehicles. On top of that, governments can not only support public transport  but encourage people to own bikes and scooters. For instance, cities that are very crowded are not available to install vehicles that are adequate for their population, in this case, it is effective for citizens to have vehicles such as bikes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, putting money into developing public transport could attract more passengers   , but there are other ways that would have better outcomes. Moreover, the contamination level of vehicles would not decrease considerably.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary times, one school of thought holds that being elderly is harmful development, whereas others assert that it helps their lives be more comfortable. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favour of the latter notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why an increase in age could negatively affect each inhabitant. First and foremost, it could lead the elderly to lose their financial independence. This is because they might no longer be able to adapt to the requirements of a job, particularly manual labour jobs, which could lower their salaries or even be fired. Furthermore, old citizens might become a burden to their families. For example, they are at high risk of having serious health problems such as heart diseases or cancer in the worst scenario. As a result, their children and offspring have to work overtime to pay treatment expenses as well as struggle more to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons why I am convinced that becoming the aged has several profound merits. One rationale is that they might have numerous lived experiences. Because of this, they could quickly handle the issues that happened in their families or workplaces, thereby protecting them from depression, anxiety, and nervousness. Another justification is that aged individuals could have a stable life. To be more specific, they cannot easily pay their living costs such as accommodation, food, and bills, but also have a budget for their hobbies, which allows them to completely enjoy their lives as well as brings a bright future to their children.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is irrefutable that  old age could adverse impact on the number of  citizens, I would contend that it could have underestimated advantages.'",

Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the ultimate purpose of  science should be to serve merely  humans or it should be used to serve other creatures. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that animals and the Earth have the same right as humans to be improved by the help of  science. The reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the physical issues, it is an indisputable fact that although science has a long way to go in curing untreated fatal ailments in humans, hazardous diseases in animals have the same right to be treated with the help of science. Parva viruses, which kill thousands of dogs around years, globally are a salient example of this. Despite the simplicity of the process of curing, abandoning infected dogs untreated would lead to their death. Thus, trying to find scientific solutions to remove such detrimental viruses that jeopardise animals' lives is essential.\r\n\r\nSecondly and even more importantly, though, should be  preserving the Earth and addressing its challenges, as a habitat for all creatures including animals and humans. It is obvious that humans have caused the Earth to sustain  considerable losses like air pollution as well as Ozone layer puncture, which disrupt the natural ecosystem. So, rather than neglecting the environment as a trivial issue, paying attention to it in science and persisting in finding ways in order to deal with those difficulties are of significant importance.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that rather than having such a  selfish attitude towards utilizing science for merely humans' benefits , possessing a comprehensive view toward applying science to the advancement of animals, the environment seems more logical. So, applying science in a comprehensive way is likely to be in humans' own interest.'",

It seems to me that, music decreases perturbation and heals the soul, and I will explain why in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, music can cause positive thoughts in the mind so, it could be operative in stress treatment and prevent its\u2019 drawbacks. Therefore, music would increase optimism, creativity and self-confidence. For example, if students listen to relaxation music before an exam, they will have higher concentration and better performance to pass their exam. Furthermore, people, who listen to light music, would be able to recover from mental conditions faster when they face critical situations. A second factor is that medical researches prove that music can influence most body organs by changing brain waves. It means that the nervous system can raise or decrease respiration and heart rates. Thus, music can eliminate the consequences of tension on the body. For instance, doctors use music therapy to cure patients who suffer from high blood pressure and anxiety. This leads us to the final and perhaps most momentous element, that energetic music could lessen the impacts of trepidation and invigorate us to do heavy activities easily. For example, athletes that do endurance sports such as cycling have better performance when they listen to this kind of music during practice. Music brings about releasing endorphin hormone which make enjoyment feeling. As a result, muscle pain will be alleviated and athletes can do more practice without any anxiety.\r\n\r\n It is true that some kinds of music like metal may enhance dangerous and violent behaviors during driving. Despite this, it seems that the ideal outcomes of music on body and mind are undeniable and sometimes it works better than medicines. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, music can reduce tension and ameliorate life conditions by advancing inspiration and self-confidence, improving heart function and blood pressure and vitalizing. Although some music may cause brutal manners by choosing proper music we could cut down the concerns and pressures in our lives.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is often believed that sweet drinks should be made less affordable to encourage individuals to intake less sugar. I totally agree with this statement as I think that consuming a lot of sugar causes health deterioration.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is true that the obesity rate has been rising recently. This is mainly because of increased sugar consumption. To illustrate, a notable study conducted by Korea University revealed a strong connection between the rate of sugar intake and obesity. The more people become friendly to sweet drinks, the more they get in danger of obesity. Moreover, cheap sugary beverages are also disadvantageous to the elderly who are highly sensitive to diabetes as they culminate in prevailed diabetes problem. Hence, an effective deterrent to buying sugary drinks is needed. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, sweet drinks should be made more high-priced because it can be a driving force behind stimulating the public to drink fresh water. To be specific, they will choose to consume water which is overly inexpensive compared to sweet beverages as they think water is cost-effective. For instance, if a Coke costs a fortune, customers are reluctant to buy it. They may think that consuming other drinks with no sugar contained and low price is the better option as they are not only healthy but also cheap. Thus, changing the price of sweet beverages is considerable.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that drinks with a lot of sugar should be costly to deter people from consuming them too much. Therefore, governments have to impose caps on beverage companies to set their sales price at a higher level.'",

It is clear that the downsides of working long hours including relationship issues, as well as, mental, and physical complications outweigh the benefits of increased productivity and extra income.\r\n\r\nFirstly, one major drawback of people prioritizing work over personal time is relationship conflicts. This is due to them not having free time to spend with their loved ones, making their bond weaken over time. As a result, one may face family arguing and friendship loss. As an example, studies have shown that entrepreneurs often get divorced when trying to achieve success, as a consequence of their work habits.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, another negative side of individuals who do not have enough time for themselves concerns their psychological and physical health and the potential risk of developing diseases. This is because their workout routine and hobby habits may be compromised due to a shortage of free time. For example, anxiety and tendonitis are often some of the main consequences of people overworking themselves and not being able to exercise regularly.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also a few merits to this lifestyle. For instance, productivity is usually increased due to workers being able to complete more tasks by working a few more hours at night, instead of keeping to commercial hours. Additionally, employees have the opportunity to ask for a pay rise as a reward for their effort, while self-employers may earn more income by delivering more products to clients.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are some advantages to doing extra hours at work, such as achieving higher productivity and earning more income, there are more significant disadvantages that should be considered, including relationship difficulties, as well as, mental and physical illness. Therefore, to achieve a healthier lifestyle individuals should try balancing leisure time with their work routine.'",

For instance, a hobby such as playing sports could demonstrate an applicant's ability to work in a team, while knowledge of foreign languages could highlight their adaptability and willingness to learn new things. Additionally, providing clues about one's marital status might be useful in jobs that require relocation or long hours, as it could reveal the candidate's flexibility and family responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can lead to discrimination and bias. Some employers may use this information to make assumptions about the contestant's gender, age, or ethnicity, which could result in unfair treatment or a missed opportunity for the applicant. For instance, a married female candidate may be perceived as less committed and less likely to accept long working hours. Additionally, providing personal information may not be relevant to the job requirements and could be considered an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, authorities should focus on evaluating candidates based on their qualifications and work experience rather than their personal data.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There has been quite an obvious discussion around the topic of learning from travelling. While some people believe that tourists cannot learn anything during their vacations, others would argue that they may gain new life story by getting out of their routine. I will show both sides of view in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there is no doubt that the aims of the trip could be relaxation, entertainment or engagement with the guide tours which do not let the travellers understand different cultures or learn the way of life where they visit. This is because activities such as staying in resorts and lounging on the beaches often overlook the complexities and curiosity of local life and culture. For instance, people who intend to recover from their stress would prefer to stay calm at the accommodation or enjoy the magnificent landscape instead of letting themselves in the local life way.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that travel is a powerful educational tool that encourages openness, curiosity and learning new journal. Engaging with different cultures and environments prompts tourists to step out of their comfort zones which leads to significant personal growth. This is based on the fact that there are many places that have been discovered by tourist during their navigation. For example, there is a place in Thailand that was found by a group of travellers while discovering deeper forests in the southern part. As a result, vacations could let people learn about new experiences, languages and so on, if they intend to do so.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the educational potential of tourism largely depends on the mindset and intentions of the traveller, Those who approach  their travel with a willingness to learn, embrace new experiences and put themselves in local communities can indeed learn and personal growth. On the other hand, tourism that prioritizes comfort and entertainment over genuine cultural engagement may offer limited opportunities for learning'",

Some people still believe that there are many other important things which should be learned outside  school and studies are not very important. I completely disagree with this statement and this essay will provide relevant examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\nFirstly, school time is a crucial phase for the students where they are nurtured and taught the basics. The education that schools provide is very  important for them to grow in their life. The schools are not limited to studies, they are also providing sports, language, soft skills and many other classes to help their students grow in their lives. For example, there are many students who are regular to school and studies which helps them to pass the school with a bright future. On the other side, there are many other students who are irregular or spend more time outside school and end up failing in their classes.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are many other things which are taught outside of the school but that is not their age to learn those kinds of things. Children going to school are around the age of 7 to 18 years and that is a very sensitive age where they should focus on their studies rather than spending  time outside of their schools. For example,  students who learn outside the school may know real-world situations but they may lack the basic education, skills and manners.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with the idea that students should stop studying and learn from outside as their age is quite young to understand these kinds of things.

This, is a terrible consequence, because is important to preserve our identity as a nation. Because of this, I strongly disagree with this statement, and I do so for several reasons that I will develop throughout the essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, what makes a country special and different from each other is the culture, and heritage is based on the traditions of every country. For instance, typical food, folklore, landscapes and  beliefs. But, when the evolution of some process leaves behind the old way that our ancestors just did  it that is when we lose our identity. This, is why we keep museums and we teach our children at school about the past and typical stuff, because we need to keep them alive for future generations. It is beautiful when nations preserve and show respect for past times and history  because is the only way to generate a friendly relationship between technology and culture.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is very exciting when countries are able to create new technologies, in order to improve the quality of people's life. For example, the Japanese population created the famous bullet train to travel around the country in a short period of time. However, even when they felt very proud about this huge milestone, because is the fastest in the world, they still preserve old ways of transportation, such as boat by row or maybe the taxi bikes. Therefore, when the tourist visits them they can learn from both ways modern and traditional.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, when new advances are an important part of nations' evolution it is also relevant to keep old skills  because that makes every place special and unique. and of course, both can be preserved in harmony. Heritage should be promoted around the world because that reminds us where we come from and how hard we have been working since then to reach unexpected developments.'",

In this essay, I will discuss the reason for this effort. In addition, why I do consider it as a negative development.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that, when a business suchas acompany launches a new product, it definitely wants to have a considerable sale and because advertising has a crucial role in introducing goods, the company makes its effort to illustrate the goods as a new thing. It would be the best approach to deal with other competitor companies as well as previous versions or editions of the same product. The majority of people usually have a tendency to seek new arrivals in order to possess the latest things which they believe are the best goods. It can happen in different aspects such as technology, fashion or even home decoration.\r\n\r\nI am also convinced that, such advertisements have a significant drawback as they encourage people to spend more and more money on the staff that they already possess, which is an obvious type of consumerism. For instance, every other year cutting-edge electronic gadgets like smartphones are launched, while they literally have insignificant improvements compared with the past versions even in their appearance and many people consume a huge amount of money to have them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having the desire to sell more leads companies to insist on advertising their products as they are new in some aspects.

With the impact of technology, the question of whether the Science and Technology curriculum is more crucial compared to the History curriculum has become a matter of considerable debate. This essay will delve into both perspectives before presenting my own opinion.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, proponents of History argue that it plays a crucial role in fostering a deep understanding of the past, allowing individuals to comprehend the present and anticipate the future. Through the study of historical events, students develop analytical skills, learn to evaluate evidence, and gain insight into human behavior. Moreover, History provides valuable lessons that can guide decision-making and promote tolerance and empathy by understanding diverse perspectives.\r\n\r\nConversely, advocates for Science and Technology contend that these subjects are indispensable in addressing contemporary challenges and driving innovation and progress.

Do you think this is positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'Sports have always been an integral part of human civilization, bringing people together and promoting physical and mental well-being. However, there is a debate that some countries choose to achieve this success. Some countries focus on building specialized facilities to train top athletes, while others provide sports facilities that everyone can use. This essay will explore the positive and negative aspects of this approach and provide my opinion on this topic.\r\n\r\n    On the one hand, there are several benefits to building facilities for training top athletes.\r\n\r\nFirstly, these facilities are equipped with technology, providing particularized athletes with the best possible training. This can result in better performance and improved techniques, giving the country an edge in international competitions. In addition, particularized facilities allow for tailored training programs and individual attention, which is crucial for elite athletes to reach their full potential. This can also lead to a boost in national pride and a sense of achievement when the country's athletes bring home medals and honors from intentional events.\r\n\r\n    However, on the other hand, this approach can have negative consequences. Focusing only on training the best athletes risks neglecting basic sports development. This may lead to a lack of access to sports opportunities for the general population. Additionally, not everyone has the talent or resources to become an elite athlete, and the emphasis on dedicated facilities may discourage people from participating in sports at a recreational level.

Is this a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'In recent years increasing number of rural residents have decided to leave their living places and farms to join the people in big cities. This decision has brought a special concern regarding a prompt decline in the population of the rural areas. From my personal point of view, this issue has more negative impacts than positive results, both for the villages and the cities.\r\n\r\nI would like to start off my discussion by writing about why the country people decide to migrate to the cities. First of all, there is less variety of jobs in villages and workforces need to be really hard working and strong to be able to deal with agriculture and other related jobs. Secondly, for that amount of work-load, the workers get paid less compared with the similar working hours in the cities. Therefore, more and more rural people get settled in the cities every day. In addition, another significant factor is the better living facilities in most aspects of life in cities such as a better transportation system and definitely a more advanced educational system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this issue has some detrimental impacts on both cities and urban areas. One of the most important disadvantages is that in the long-term there will be less workforces in the rural areas so the economy of the villages and the farming industry will be damaged. For instance, the production of fresh fruits, vegetables and other farming products will be reduced and as a result, the prices of those will rise dramatically. Moreover, the population in the cities will increase significantly and this overpopulation will in turn put more pressure on the resources due to the evergrowing demands. Accordingly, governments must take some measures to prevent this.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, nowadays, an increasing number of rural residents migrate to the cities due to the lack of facilities in the villages and the better opportunities in the cities. But, this is damaging for both cities and urban areas. So, to avoid this, governments ought to seek some solutions.'",

Can you suggest some solutions to this issue ?' \n 'Text': 'In today's fast-paced society, the pursuit of work-life balance has become a significant challenge for individuals across the globe. While many aspire to harmonize their professional commitments with personal and familial responsibilities, the reality often falls short of this ideal. The main problems this causes are exhaustion, mental health issues and strained relationships with family and friends, and the most viable solutions are fostering a culture that values work-life balance, prioritizing self-care and setting realistic boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe lack of balance between work and personal life can give  rise to a multitude of problems, both for individuals and society. Firstly, excessive dedication to work can lead to burnout and mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The relentless pursuit of career success at the expense of personal well-being destroys physical and emotional health, diminishing the overall quality of life. Moreover, strained relationships with family and friends might occur due to the demands of work that  steal  precious time that could be spent nurturing meaningful connections. This destruction of social bonds might escalate the feelings of isolation and loneliness, further increasing the negative impact on mental health.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, several solutions can be considered. Firstly, employers play a crucial role in fostering a culture that values work-life balance. Implementing flexible working arrangements, such as telecommuting and compressed workweeks, allows employees greater autonomy in managing their time and responsibilities. Additionally, establishing clear boundaries between work and personal life, such as enforcing email curfews and discouraging overtime, can help mitigate the risk of burnout and promote employee well-being.\r\n\r\n On an individual level, prioritizing self-care and setting realistic boundaries is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This may involve practising mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques, as well as allocating dedicated time for leisure activities and spending quality time with loved ones. Learning to delegate tasks and say no to excessive work demands is also paramount in reclaiming control over one's time and energy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the imbalance between work and other aspects of life poses significant challenges for individuals and society as a whole, manifesting in issues such as burnout, and strained relationships. By implementing solutions that promote work-life balance at both the organizational and individual levels, we can mitigate these problems and create a healthier, more fulfilling environment for all'",

For instance, wild animals come to the villages to search for water and food and they destroy peasants cultivation and those who do not come out from the forest die themselves. Truly, it is the most predominant one, and it has many negative consequences in various ways. Secondly, it has significantly increased who die from elephant attacks. Moreover, humans encroach habitats of animals for their own needs because of that they come out of the forest and die in road accidents.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the whole world is focusing on educating citizens about the positive impacts of protecting forests\r\n\r\nin conclusion, although it needs to be done for the development of a country, logging of the rainforest is indeed too dire to ignore.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Spoken communication is more powerful than written communication\u201d. Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: oral and  written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people.'",

How has this affected the lives of workers?\r\n\r\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of having modern transportation. Support your answer with specific reasons and example.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, transportation has become increasingly prominent. While some contemplate that is has improved unemployment, some argue it is not worth missing out on quality family time. Personally, I strongly advocate for the former view. However, this essay will explore the benefits and drawbacks of this phenomenon, whereafter an opinion will be given. \r\n\r\nOne paramount benefit that modern transportation offers is the unparalleled convenience it offers workers. Given this, the benefits to this are twofold; individuals are able to reside in residential areas that are far away from their workplaces and they can work across international borders. To illustrate this, Sallyport Global has over five different nationalities working for them, where employees rotate on a monthly roster. Furthermore, public transportation such as metro and busses makes it possible for people to work remotely, or attend meetings in different regions. Thus, it is essential to underscore that today's transportation is beneficial for employment. \r\n\r\nAlthough there is merit in contemporary transportation, it fails to accommodate a work-life balance. For example, a study done at Harvard University concluded that 85% of workers spend more than 50 hours a week at their jobs, which exceeds the recommended time of only 40 hours a week. Moreover, occupations where individuals are required to stay for a long duration can impact their families momentously. Despite this, it is imperative to find an adequate job in today's society, even if it requires travelling. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the advancement of transportation has influenced workers in numerous ways. Transportation allowed for more people to find jobs, while it kept them from their families in some cases. It is my contention that this phenomenon has more benefits than drawbacks. If transportation continues to improve, then more economies could benefit from a better unemployment rate in the foreseeable future.'",

Furthermore, global warming seems to be related to levels of pollution in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the causes of global warming and possible solutions to the problem.' \n 'Text': 'Many researchers are worrying in case of global warming. Study indicates that the temperature of the world is increasing. Moreover, seems the world's heat is related to emissions that are released by human activities in the air. I believe this issue needs urgent acts of all countries to cut down their use of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nTo begin with,  world warming is an unavoidable fact that we can sense its impacts on our life such as warmer summers and fewer snowfalls. These occurrences are caused by humankind, because of their massive use of  fossil fuels and their inability to replace them. As a result , by substances  released from burning this source, massive emissions will be produced such as carbon dioxide. Additionally, the increasing population needs accommodation and to provide this governments have to cut down trees and expand the city area so forests do not have enough chance to purify the air and air gradually will be more polluted. For instance, a survey has shown that  the amount of fuel that people use has increased dramatically because of their demand for industry and transportation also they estimated this figure will rise continuously to the peak and if we ignore it in the next 100 years our earth will be unlivable.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this problem,  governments have to introduce some plans for the limitation of fossil material and other kinds of laws to protect the planet for the next generation. One of the solutions is, that they can start to use more renewable sources such as solar or wind and invest more money to develop it and make it use for replacing  fossil energy. For example, many nations in Europe invested a huge amount of money in clean energy and they used it for households, consequently, the figure for emissions decreased significantly.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people are using more harmful energy and it is causing  global warming . I believe  this happening needs urgent attention and all nations have to act. They can provide some laws and a number of limitations to cut down the radiation.'",

What are the reasons and what should be done to tackle the problem?' \n 'Text': 'In the cutting-edge century, there have been many electronic devices promoted for decades. This tendency leads to numerous parents spending money on these products for playing and entertaining their children rather than bringing them to do physical activities as the products are more convenient than others. This essay will expound on the reasons and provide possible solutions to address them.\r\n\r\nTo commence, one of the main reasons is to be more convenient. For instance, It is a common fact that dozens of parents are working adults in my city. They utilise electronic devices for their youngsters to learn online lessons such as speaking classes, playing musical instruments and so on day-by-day. When their children finish the online lessons, they can play games for long hours. This can save time and not worry about their son or daughters meeting some injuries when they go outside. Another reason is to establish younger ones building up their tech-products skills for preparing to be adulthood. For these reasons, this is more likely to affect some adults preferring to let younger ones game instead of doing physical exercises.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some reasons are serious, many probable suggestions can be taken. To begin with, the obvious solution is to combine sports and online classes. For example, guidance people can set up a timetable for learners, when they have a break, they can play some badminton on the table or strengthen their muscles to avoid a chronic illness. The other measure is to limit their gaming time. Maturing people can build up a routine for learners following up to mitigate their gaming time for the contribution of their sports time. Thus, this tends to help a large number of students manage their routine and well-being.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the statement above, I believe that tech products can provide a great way for students to study, while if guidance people have to combine sports and online classes and use a routine to limit their gaming time, this should address the issues, also children have their private and entertaining period. This would be better for their mental development to be positive as releasing stress.'",

While some critics argue that creative artists should be allowed to illustrate their views in any form, some believe there should be restrictions on what they do. Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. Thus, art has a way of coalescing diverse groups and establishing a sense of belonging, while it also promoting freedom of speech. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is essential to underscore the impact that art has on members of society. For instance, Dr James Edward advises his patients with anxiety and depression to join art communities, because expressing yourself can improve mental health by 20%.  Moreover, artistic gatherings are objective by nature, so people often form strong bonds with fellow individuals who relate to the abstractness of the world. Thus, I believe that artists should be allowed to let their creative personalities flourish. \r\n\r\nSecondly, one paramount benefit it offers is the unparalleled convenience it offers citizens of a country. For example. the police department of New York mentioned that 75% of domestic abuse victims have decided to talk to the police because of the graphical representations painted all over the rural buildings in their area. Given this, activists for violence, rape and women's rights use art to illustrate their point of view; which can inspire numerous victims to stand up for themselves.  Therefore, in my opinion, allowing artists to express themselves has instilled freedom of speech. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some believe that art should be allowed to express oneself, while some say there should be restrictions. However, it is evident that it can connect different groups of individuals for the better and motivate confidence to stand up for one's rights. Thus, if art continues to grow worldwide, then it might benefit the human race in the foreseeable future.'",

What measures can be taken to solve these problems.' \n 'Text': 'Relocating the population from the countryside to modern cities for job opportunities might have many issues in both locations. I believe it can reduce the number of people who work in the agricultural industry and gradually the people would challenged by lack of the  food sources.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the modern and reformed metropolis are a popular range for the majority of the citizens because they offer numerous numbers of chances for adults to work and gain reasonable salaries, by contrast, grownups who work in farming areas and deal with more hardships \u060ctheir payment  about half of the workers in reformed cities. As a result, staff consider living in rural is more convenient and also they can live better. Moreover, the number of facilities that are provided in central locations are uncountable, although, communities who live in urban are unable to take benefit of it so prefer to change their living place. To tackle this problem up is essential to provide equality for all levels of society and avoid categorizing areas for distributing wealth. For instance, In some cases, governments of modern countries have provided loans for those who want to live in the countryside and they provide a good road system and schools for the community and people from all walks of life are returning to their first living area.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, if farming areas disappeared in the long term  humans would struggle with the shortage of ingredients because a significant number of our products have been brought to us by that community. Another drawback  is by gradually ignoring farm locations those places will destroyed and we lose the chance of having a natural and clean environment. For example, after the Industrial Revolution, a massive digit of families relocated to modern areas and their natural places were eliminated and reformed into high-raised buildings.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, moving the population from local areas to modern cities has many disadvantages such as a lack of food sources and the danger of destroying natural habitats. To solve this problem, governments could provide some support for those families and make their lives more convenient.'",

Who do you think should take responsibility?' \n 'Text': 'In this modern era, people are running short of their time and due to that, they are not able to take care of the elders. On the other side, there are many elders who don't have their families and  are under the government's supervision. I personally believe that taking care of elders should be a family's responsibility. Moving forward, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\nIf we talk about care, our parents and elders used to take care of us when we were children. They were also facing similar issues related to time management but they still managed to do it. In this era, the story is opposite where family members don't have much time to take care of their elders and as a result, they send them to government-funded old age homes. For example, I had one relative who was tired of taking care of his mother and he decided to send his mother to government-funded homes. What if our elders did the same with us when we were children and sent us to the government?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the government should definitely look after the elderly who don't have their immediate family members with them. There are many elders who are alone and there is no one to take care of them, in that case, the government is a perfect source of help. For example, I had one family friend who died in a road accident and there was no one to take care of his parents. His parents then  mutually decided to move to a government-funded house where they could spend time with other elderly and try to forget their child who is no more.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the elders who have their immediate family members alive  should be taken care of by their family. The rest of the elders, who are totally alone should be taken care of by the government.'",

What is your opinion of crime fiction and TV crime dramas?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, in several countries, the number of followers for the crime genre, in television shows and book titles, is increasing gradually. I think this rise is due to the feeling that this genre is giving to fans and they can experience some things that are rare in their daily lives.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, through these years the population has shown extra attention to criminal subjects and anybody can be noticed by these uncountable topics that are posted or published during the day. This title has mystery and hidden excitement that stimulates the inner feelings of fans to follow it. Additionally, companies have noticed that citizens are frustrated with this routine life and the majority of them are like some new challenges for their mind, and fortunately, this genre can easily attract people. For example, the Netflix app illustrated the top chart for its films and more than 70 per cent of that chart were criminal titles. I believe this  type lets  humans  imagine that process and gives them a chance to escape from this demanding world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I think as a result of the rising popularity of crime titles, writers find that it can be developed into several sub-fields such as dramas and fiction. These subgenres let followers  connect more with the idea of the publisher or the producer, moreover, I like to investigate those types because  like others they trigger my feelings and seem fascinating. For instance,  Marvel studio is one of the well-known in this title and their company has many movies on this topic, their comics are popular too and this development is because they know about the real patient of their viewers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the number of crime subject fans has grown noticeably because the population are suffering from repetitive life and needs things new to make their life more interesting so they follow these kinds of topics to imagine those situations and alter their mood.'",

Personally, I strongly advocate the former view.

To illustrate this, Psychologist, Dr. Edward Sullen, conducted a study at Harvard University where he was able to decrease depression among his patients by 35% just by introducing them to a concatenation of new experiences.

For instance, Ingo Farming is a family company that has flourished in the vineyard business for over 500 years, in which they remain to what they know - winemaking.

In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will elucidate both aspects and try to give a reasonable conclusion from my viewpoint. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, proponents of the idea which is about removing non-academic subjects from the school syllabus allege that these subjects do not matter in pupils\u2019 education, they see these kinds of classes as a waste of time. For instance, students who participate in these classes can be attracted by these kinds of activities, and as a result   , students may ignore other subjects in order to show great performance and enhance their skills related to these fields. Moreover, if someone has innate skills and is the best among their peers, they can be directed to these sectors by  professionals, and in the long run, they will not have any time for their education.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the coin, it is an inevitable fact that the importance of co-educational branches of study is various. To exemplify, students need breaks and refresh their minds between tiring classes to concentrate on each subject well, while some can do it easily during the breaks, for others engaging in physical activities can be more effective as it promotes some individuals with a sense of fulfilment, relaxation and being away from the stress. Additionally, naturally gifted students can gain experience and improve their skills by attending these kinds of branches.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after being manifested both points, while some people are convinced that the subjects which are not related to academic studies should be eliminated from the list of subjects, I am absolutely against  this attitude.

This trend has sparked a controversy among the advocates and critics, both presenting valid arguments. I wholeheartedly agree that more time is given to book knowledge in comparison to practical knowledge that is more necessary.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n To begin with, the primary reason is when more focus is left on learning facts and figures, then learners can score excellent score in their exams, but they will not have any practical knowledge. For instance, there are a certain number of schools in Punjab that render computer education from books related to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in class, but their students do not know how and where to use these sites in daily life. Thus, this is just a waste of time. Furthermore, with advancements in technology, most multinational companies prefer to hire employees based on their skills, rather than academic scores. Hence, making students devote more time to learning facts is not useful in the future anymore as it is not helpful in career growth.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n Moreover, it is cheap to provide book knowledge to children, instead of providing them with real equipment to learn from. It costs enormously high to school authorities when students do real experiments with chemicals in chemistry class. Although most institutes spend more time on books, not on skills, it is essential to include experiments in students because they help adults to see reality and analyze their abilities to choose their careers.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n To conclude, as per the matrimonial mentioned above, I can say that most colleges try to spend more on learning facts, but I believe that it is not beneficial for the tutees.

Some people think that it would be better for the environment and economy if people ate only the local food produced by farmers.' \n 'Text': 'There is a common argument that advocating for the consumption of purely locally sourced food would have positive effects on both the environment and the economy. I strongly disagree, since the absence of a diverse range of veggies and fruits will have detrimental effects on several regions. Conversely, some individuals within the community may possess a surplus of resources. The following paragraphs will explain the drawbacks of the perspective and provide pertinent examples. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is important to note that many regions throughout the globe exhibit distinct climatic conditions that might potentially disrupt agricultural growth. Certain strategies thrive in warm weather, while others thrive in cold weather. For instance, a coconut needs a humid and warm atmosphere in order to thrive and endure. Consequently, regions with low temperatures would lack access to these items if they are not delivered, along with several other food items. As a result, the population will experience negative consequences since the body needs essential vitamins derived from vegetables and fruits. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, several crops provide a substantial quantity of items that need fast consumption. Otherwise, they will get obsolete and become obsolete. For example, it is necessary to consume fruits such as strawberries, bananas, and apples for a period of one week after their ripening stage. If the communities only consume local food, they would be unable to get it quickly and a significant portion of it would be squandered. Hence, it is essential to distribute the produce to other regions, not only to mitigate wastage but also to facilitate the commerce of the whole harvest. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I believe that food should not be only eaten by local residents, but rather supplied to other regions that need it in order to minimise waste and enhance enterprises' profitability. Furthermore, everybody around the globe would be granted universal access to all Vitamins'",

What do you think are the causes of this problem and what measures could be taken to solve it?' \n 'Text': 'In some nations, despite the decreasing rates of serious crimes, people tend to feel less secure compared to the past. The most obvious causes are previously committed crimes and the detailed description of such criminal scenes on the news, and the most viable solutions are more safety measures in place and detail of any serious case should be banned on the news.\r\n\r\nSometimes, previously committed crimes make people feel less protected. This is because they still have memories of criminal cases and how they happened in the past. As a result, they tend to feel insecure whenever a stranger's presence exists. Moreover, watching the news which contains detailed cruel acts of criminals also leads to unsafe feelings. That is to say, If television and other types of news media visualize the scene of serious crimes too realistically, it will potentially result in destructive mental health, making people afraid of going outdoors and worried about what terrible situation could happen to them. For example, many studies indicate that several individuals are tendentially anxious about going outside after witnessing news of serial murders.\r\n\r\nA possible solution to this issue is putting more safety measures in place in order to help people to feel safer. This gives people a sense of security and a way to protect themselves as well as seek help when they are in danger. Another viable solution is regulating and filtering the information published in news media.

Some societies have a notion that experiments on animals should be halted, while others contend that it is important to emphasize the contributions which these trials have to science. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will delve into the ways for regulations and possible alternatives, and provide a logical conclusion. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the cruelty of human beings is undeniable and it can indicate its effects on many landscapes. Thus, there is no doubt that scholars do a plethora of experiments and try to find a way to stave off grave illnesses, reducing the risk of potential threats, increasing the levels of well-being among individuals, and  creating a more peaceful and soothing atmosphere within societies. However, even if they attempt to enhance the life quality of humans, their activities can directly affect animals which are the bedrock of the whole ecosystem. \r\n\r\nTurning to the methods to protect the habitats, the adjustments are manifold to preclude the detrimental actions which they can be faced with. Initially, the executive powers should take some measures to raise the awareness among public, promoting to buying of vegan products instead of other cosmetics and pharmaceuticals which are tested on animals. Additionally, if specific animal species have some similarities to people, for example, in terms of skin texture, there should be some creatures or plants which are similar to them. Therefore, science needs more time to work on this problem and has to find some other modes. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this tendency, it is evident that societies should be highly cognizant of the products  they buy to mitigate the number of tests on animals. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts, alleviating its dire ramifications while harnessing the benefits of scientific experiments.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In recent years,there has been a growing debate regarding what the main purpose of museums should be.While some assert that museums should be a place where individuals can enjoy themselves as it can be a more effective way of learning as well as gaining more income,others,including me,believe that the major aim of museums should become to educate people because  it is for gaining deeper understanding and broadening horizons of people,not for entertaining .\r\n\r\nOn the one side,it is widely believed by some that museums should become entertainment places as it can be beneficial for both the museum and individuals as well.Firstly,if the museums serve as an entertainment centre,it can attract many people to there.Consequently, people can obtain more income,which can be advantageous for the economy of the country.For example,there are many museums in the United States which serve as an enjoyable place and more and more visitors come there for entertainment and increased revenue can be procured.Secondly,it is also can be beneficial for individuals as it can learn about artefacts and other historical objects in a more effective way.As going to museums may be boring for residents,turning them into enjoying places can attract many people to go the museums for learning .By learning about these objects in an amusing way ,the community can be aware of history without feeling bored.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,I would side with those who believe that the main purpose of museums is to inform people,not to amuse them.I believe that  museums should enrich the knowledge of visitors and give accurate information about the  history of  artefacts or other historical objects.In this case,people can gain accurate knowledge about these objects and can appreciate the importance of them ,which can lead to a more educated society. \r\n\r\nTaking everything into account,the question of whether  museums should serve as  amusement centres or educational institutions has valid points on both sides.However,it seems to me that their main aim should be to inform the population so they can acknowledge the importance of their history as well as broaden their knowledge.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree.' \n 'Text': 'In this day and age, there are some environmental issues which are too big to be controlled by each person or individual country. On the other hand, it is a global problem  these days. As far as I am concerned, I completely agree with this point of view. This essay will discuss both sides, thoroughly.  \r\n\r\n   To commence with the negative effects. First and foremost, environmental problems include air pollution, lack of water, deforestation and others. It leads to an international complication. Neither each city nor individual persons is able to tackle  these issues. This is because as I mentioned above, it is becoming a global  problem day by day. Apart from that, for the being time, almost all of the countries are cutting the trees for making various furniture or for  construction or for  other purposes. Therefore, there are not enough trees in order to provide  oxygen. Then, it will cause  air pollution. Furthermore, people use water for unnecessary things or tasks  these days. For instance, local people utilize water for agriculture more than they require. So, it leads to a lack of water.\r\n\r\n   On the one hand, there are some positive impacts on the population. First of all,  driving cars cause  air pollution. If they do not drive their own cars, they should use the public transport. However, there are some difficulties that they have to cope with. For example, having not enough seats, overcrowding, noise or others. Not only driving vehicles are causing  air pollution, but  factories  and industrial companies have a negative influence too. But in some countries, the government cannot ban these companies. If they do, there will be unemployment. Thus, the government is not able to forbid it. Not only for the country  but also for the population of this country. \r\n\r\n   By  way of conclusion, I once again restate my position creating more environmental troubles is making  life around the world more complicated.'",

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year, and give your own opinion about whether it is a good idea.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, an increasing number of students prefer to take a year off after finishing high school. Some of them believe that they will gain useful experiences this way. In this essay, I would like to write about the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.\r\n\r\nI would like to start by writing about the advantages of this idea. First of all, students who are in favour of this idea believe that by taking a gap year before going to university they would be able to find a job during this period which gives them significant hands-on experiences that might help them with their future careers. Moreover, they can save up some money that can be used for their upcoming education. In addition, they can use this period to hang out more with their friends and families or for example, spend their time travelling. Those kinds of activities will give them enough social skills and insight about life and other opportunities as a result, they can make better and more practical decisions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, opponents might claim that if students get away from studying and occupy themselves with working and other aspects of life, there is less possibility of going back to school and completing their qualifications. As a result, they will have fewer working options and less chance to get a promotion. Therefore, their life satisfaction will decrease dramatically. Meanwhile, not all the students do something productive during this gap.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, based on what is discussed above, there are obvious benefits and drawbacks to delaying going to university. In my opinion, schools should provide enough information for students to guide them and students should make their decisions eventually based on the aim of their life.'",

What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this situation?\r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.' \n 'Text': 'One of the most prevalent trends in the contemporary world is the cumulative increase in playing with digital devices. It is completely agreed that  the lack of physical exercise and eating unhealthy diets is the main reason for obesity. This essay will discuss both causes and solutions before constructing an inference.\r\n\r\nOne cause of obesity is the excess eating habits of junk food from the markets, which contains more energy and fats. Another factor is the  lack of physical exercise, teenagers after school come at home and play video games and watch television. They spend all their time sitting at home in front of screens, which affects  their brain and health. For example, recently a  report printed from the Blacktown Hospital, New South Wales, 25% of students are suffering from obesity and anxiety. As a result, it is evident that undergraduates do not  listen to their parents and get fat.\r\n\r\nThe best solution is  physical activities, such as sports and swimming. Parents should send their tutees to play games and do physical exercises. In addition, make a timetable, so pupils can follow that table and perform tasks accordingly.Moreover, add a healthy diet to their daily routine food. Furthermore, take them for picnics and hiking once  a month, so they can physically fit and mix with other peers. For instance, Elon Musk, confirmed in an interview that  his children are following a strict timetable. As a consequence, it is apparent why his family is so healthy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the analysis of causes and solutions, it is clear that teachers and parents should put hard rules and regulations on sophomores, so they  can get rid of obesity and live a happy life. Further, it is predicted that this development will continue in the future as well if we do not take quick action.'",

To what extent do you agree or not?' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that the extinction of animal species is not a man-made process, and people do not have any reason to halt this before happening. To be honest, I partially agree with that statement, and I will support my ideas.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, every living beings are a part of  nature. If animal species are exposed to  extinction, our lives will not be the same as it was in the past because all humans and animals are connected to each other, and there is a chain between them. If one chain breaks, it will result in the end of the whole chain. While it is true that it is a tough task to interfere with the issue of  nature, however, technology has created conducive conditions to preserve the animal species from extinction in some cases. To safeguard the animals, we will guarantee our future. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some animal species are really a threat to the presence of people. And there is no reason for people to preserve them because otherwise, it may result in the death of people. Additionally, some natural processes are indeed inevitable, so people cannot deal with the maintenance of animals, and it requires a lot of effort which people cannot tackle. For example, in the past dinosaurs were killed by the explosion of a huge asteroid, and in this situation, people would not take precautions to save dinosaurs from dying. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the extinction of animal species is done by the mother nature. Whereas it is true that people should preserve them because every living being is an inherent part of  nature, in some cases, it is not practical to save them because they are maybe so dangerous and it can require working hard.'",

There remains some disagreement as to whether it should be considered as an approving or disapproving development. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that implementing this policy would be accompanied by human advancements and environmental improvements. The reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, inadequate salaries and unaffordable expenses of life, particularly in developing countries have forced individuals to seek copyrighted music and books. According to the statistics, due to an increase in the price of paper in 2022, the cost of printed books has soared by up to 30% from 2022 to 2023. Thus, rather than spending a fortune on purchasing books , especially for school and university students, downloading them from the internet seems more logical.\r\n\r\nYet, perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this issue is the fact that downloading copyrighted books and music could be accounted as an environmentally friendly move. For instance, in 2023 availability of more books on the internet resulted in a 10% decrease in cut down trees. Otherwise, having utilized  timbers in order to produce paper would lead to irreparable ecological consequences. Admittedly, supporting the producers financially by governments and taking measures to prevent any abuse by the police could play a significant role in continuing this trend.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that downloading suites or books from the internet for free could have a significant role in the betterment of both society and the environment.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary world, purchasing things is more challenging than it used to be in the past because of stiff price competition between sellers. Therefore, people are focused on price the most despite the qualities and materials of the product. In my point of view, I agree with this statement and I will demonstrate the reasons why the crowds consider the price rather than other features and measurements. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, similar products are sold at distinct prices in the market is common and ubiquitous nowadays. Because there are many manufacturers and service providers that offer identical products and services to their customers. One of the ways to survive in the competition is to manipulate the customer by providing reasonable quotations. That is why people tend to choose services and products based on how much they will pay for them. For example, according to a recent study, the vast majority of customers who receive medical services from various medical institutions have voted they choose cheaper ones.\r\n\r\nSecondly, another reason why prices are presented differently is that there are many middle entrepreneurs who buy products from suppliers and then sell them to end-users by adding some profits. Moreover, the prices are calculated depending on how much margin is added to the cost. Therefore, it is better to compare features and prices when you purchase something. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, despite the other features and measurements, price is considered a key aspect that affects people\u2019s purchasing behaviors and attitudes because of intermediary sellers in the market and competition between producers.'",

This phrase is normally expressed to motivate the younger generation to work harder. Nevertheless, this expression is not simply applicable in real life. There are several consideration factors that determine its actualization in reality, moreover, advising children this message is also followed by certain benefits and drawbacks.\r\n\r\nSupporting children is invariably a virtuous action; it not only elevates their zeal but also caters to their emotional necessity, ensuring they are adequately backed by their families. Working towards a certain goal necessitates unwavering perseverance, and constant determination renders their aim more achievable. Nevertheless, from my perspective, it is crucial to realise one\u2019s potential as some individuals now are enduring the consequent pressure of coercion to adapt to something that does not align with their genuine ability. \r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, considerable evidence indicates that several students opt for engineering majors, motivated by the prospect of higher salaries, despite their deficiency in relevant talent.

This essay discusses some issues related to this phenomenon and a few actions to change the situation.\r\n\r\nThere are some popular effects resulting from people having bad sleep nights. The first of these are mental problems, such as difficulty concentrating and memory loss. This is because the brain cannot rest properly during the night and, as a result, some brain functions may be affected. For example, recent studies have shown that children with difficulties sleeping might not develop well at school since their brains cannot retain all the information they are exposed to. Additionally, people with sleep problems often complain about irritability and impatience. This is because when the brain is not fully rested, individuals might experience emotion variations.\r\n\r\nHowever, some actions might improve the quality of sleep. Firstly, doctors recommend to avoid using electronics during the evening, especially one hour before bedtime. The reason for this is that the human brain might get confused about whether it is time to be awake or to sleep, due to the devices' blue light. For instance, people with a lack of sleep often report that they watch TV or use their phones in bed right before they fall asleep and, consequently, they often have insomnia issues. Moreover, setting up a night routine usually helps minimize one having difficulties falling asleep. This is due to the human brain getting used to when it is time to sleep by doing the same activities every night.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main issues from not getting the ideal amount of sleep are dysfunctional brain activities, such as lack of concentration and memory loss, as well as emotional instability. The good practices to mitigate this problem are to avoid the use of screen devices in the evening and to set a night routine.'",

However, many are concerned about the potential harm of e-cigarettes and their role in leading people to become smokers. While it might be true that vaping is less dangerous than smoking, I believe the substances in e-cigarettes are proven to be harmful and addictive and should be regulated more strictly.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people argue that vaping is a safer option than smoking traditional cigarettes. They emphasise that it eliminates all the harmful substances resulting from tobacco combustion. In addition, supporters also say that e-cigarettes provide a means for smokers to stop smoking. They believe that since vaping offers the possibility to decrease the nicotine you consume gradually, it makes quitting easier. For instance, in some countries like the UK or New Zealand, e-cigarettes are promoted as an important treatment option for smokers who want to quit.\r\n\r\nHowever, critics claim that while vaping eliminates some harmful chemicals, e-cigarettes still contain addictive or dangerous substances such as nicotine or flavouring chemicals. Moreover, e-cigarettes are known to cause nicotine addiction among non-smokers, which may lead them to take up smoking. Many people who have never smoked are attracted to vaping by the aggressive marketing campaigns and the existence of many different enticing flavours, and many of them progress from e-cigarettes to tobacco. For example, vaping has become very popular among British youngsters, and there is a lot of debate about the need to implement stricter regulations because many of these vapers end up becoming smokers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it could be argued that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco and offer a potential alternative for adult smokers trying to quit, the presence of unsafe chemicals and addictive substances in e-liquids is a health risk and leads many non-smokers to start smoking. In my opinion, vaping has serious health effects, and we need stronger regulations to restrict the use of e-cigarettes and mitigate their potential risks.'",

Carbon dioxide is one of the main gases produced from the combustion of fuel minerals, but also, other toxic substances are released into the atmosphere such as VOCs or Nitrogen oxide. These substances will bitterly damage the ecosystem. It is therefore required to find new ways to produce energy, so the use of these combustibles is reduced. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of increasing the costs of fuel with the intention of reducing its use.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that governments must find solutions to the increase in pollution in the major cities. They have to make interventions so that climate change is tackled. One of the measures that the G8 organisation has explored is the increase in the costs of fuel. The theory behind this idea is that if the cost of the fuel is increased, the use would be reduced. However, studies have shown that even increasing the cost in the last years, the use of these sources of energy keeps rising.\r\n\r\nOur representatives will have to come up with new innovations to reduce the contamination levels. Scientists are our main hope. New energy sources have to be developed before the use of petrol can be downscaled. In addition, more investment must be dedicated to the investigation and development of alternative energies. \r\n\r\nSummarising, fuel is one of the main sources of energy used nowadays. However, research has shown that burning petrol generates emissions of toxic gases, that in the long run would have a big impact on the earth\u2019s temperature and on climate change. Although the use of these products has to be reduced, firstly new alternatives have to be implemented so the end user doesn\u2019t have to afford the consequences of poorly managed government strategies.'",

For instance, a study by the Habitat Protection Agency has proven that in the past few years, temperature is elevating by one per cent in every era.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are some issues to make by development in every country and they invent various types of gadgets and urbanisation is happening very fast because most companies are occupying land to build their models. Furthermore, it leads to people migrating to Metropolis places for jobs and business purposes then they stay in the cities. In the modern world devastating is doing a very large scale in all countries and it develops many problems for the animals and the environment. For example, the public survey has proven that around one thousand acres of soil are devastating every year. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, certain spaces of flora and Fiona are diminishing due to habitat issues, although other believes that only the atmosphere is a major concern. In my opinion, the government could make some laws for control. These types of consequences do not happen in the future.'",

This has caused a handful of people to carry an opinion that schools should eliminate non-academic subjects like physical education and culinary classes so that students will be able to focus on their essential academic topics instead. In this essay, I will delve into both sides of the coin and provide an explanation as to why I disagree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin, in the current climate of the job market, it is important to excel in school. With that piece of qualification, there is no doubt that opportunities will come knocking on your door. As such, by eliminating the non-essential subjects, more time could be used to focus on a more complicated subject which requires more practice for example mathematics and physics. Learning could be optimised and will also allow teachers more time to aid weaker students. For example, it is reported by that in Sweden, they only have a few subjects for the students to focus on, so as to streamline the time taken to prepare for their examinations. This has resulted in a hundred passing rate in all their examinations and students are all employed even before graduation. \r\n\r\nAlthough, with the above being said, as important as essential subjects to be, in a holistic point of view, schools also have the duty to relay messages as well as knowledge to their students about physical wellbeing through physical education and dietary wellbeing by means of culinary classes. This will allow learners to also learn about what they doing and putting into their bodies. Also, this will allow students to discover their passion outside of just regurgitating information the entire day. Students who dislike studying will have the opportunity to find an alternate path of their own through these lessons as well. In an example from Norway, students are introduced to a myriad of classes for instance gardening, for students gain a better perspective of life outside of study.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it is important to excel at school, I disagree with the statement that removing less essential subjects from their curriculum as there are also things to learn for learners holistically. Classes like physical education will instil the importance of keeping healthy and as we all know, health is the greatest wealth.'",

Some societies have a notion that there is no need for non-academic subjects, and that they should be ousted from the academic schedule, while I cannot agree with this idea wholeheartedly. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will elucidate this issue and offer a logical conclusion from my standpoint.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, proponents who support the idea of eliminating  the subjects which require creative skills instead of academic knowledge contend that students will not need them in their future lives. To exemplify, students who have different hobbies always attempt to find a way to satisfy their own interests, and in the long run, they will start to ignore their academic accomplishments and tend to be involved in practical activities. Furthermore, there is no doubt that their tendency to participate in vocational practices may result in the decreasing amount of time allocated to their education. \r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the paradigm, it is important to emphasise the significance of the subjects which can enhance the physical and mental well-being of individuals and can be helpful, in terms of developing lasting skills. For instance, if a person has a predisposition to cookery, they can constantly hone their skills to do their best, and it can give them a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment. Moreover, these subjects may have boons such as paving the way for doing something outside of the academic concept, diminishing the high levels of stress, and creating a more calming and soothing emotional status. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this thought, while some people allege that it is salient to remove the subjects which are related to physical activity and innovative skills to create  room for concentration on academic life, I do not concur with this way of thinking. I am a staunch believer that we should find a delicate balance between pursuing academic subjects and our own penchant while mitigating the dire ramifications of both stressful and  unsuccessful lives.'",

Advantages and disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'In the cutting-edge century, many automatic household appliances were promoted in human nature. This tendency leads to beneficial ways for mankind instead of drawbacks as humans can use these appliances whenever they need them. This essay will expound on both views and conclude the topic.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, automatic household products can provide many aspects for working adults or housewives such as saving time. For instance, my city has dozens of adult employees who spend a long time at work or studying. Therefore, these products such as wash-dishing, kettles and multi-rice-cookers, just press some buttons and can promote a wide range of automatic tasks accordingly. In addition, Hong Kong is a fast-paced city, if machines perform their function significantly by hand, this can benefit workers not spend much time and they can go to work on time. Thus, machines are more likely to have positive performances for mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one of the major disadvantages is frequent maintenance. To illustrate, for example, some machines like washing appliances, seem to have many problems when machines are met in the highest humidity, around over 70%, these probably do not run accurately because some engines are more difficult to work in the wet weather. Hence, this tends to monitor them accordingly and waste money and time checking them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the statement above, I believe that automatic products tend to have pros and cons. However, in the contemporary world, the products can bring out many benefits rather than drawbacks as artificially intelligent appliances are more likely to fix maintenance issues.'",

        "input": "'Question': '\\' \n 'Text': 'In this competitive society, there has been considerable debate on whether independent studying is of paramount importance. In my opinion, I go along with this learning method, and in this essay, I will support my belief with detailed explanations and specific examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly, self-study reinforces classroom knowledge and improves retention. When students review and practice what they have learned in class through self-study, it helps solidify their understanding and improves long-term retention. By revisiting concepts independently, students can identify areas of weakness and address them before exams or assessments. For example, a student studying history can use self-study to create flashcards, summarize key events, or engage in online quizzes to reinforce their understanding of historical facts and concepts. This active engagement with the material enhances learning and leads to better academic performance.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is undeniable that self-studying pupils can collect experiences as a result of self-research. A survey at Oxford University has revealed that students who apply independent studying methods are more supportive, responsible and collaborative than those who do not opt for it. In addition to this, self-study might be a better approach to specific students than traditional education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, self-study is indeed crucial for secondary school students. It promotes independence, allows for the exploration of personal interests, and reinforces classroom knowledge. By engaging in self-study, students develop important skills that will benefit them in higher education and beyond. Based on those reasons, I firmly believe that independence in studying plays a crucial role in students' knowledge retention.'",

For instance,currently case named McCarthy is highlighted in the media due to wrong judgement made by the Judge.After 8 years it was found that the person who was declared guilty was not the criminal,his friend did the accident but McCarthy was found the criminal due to negligence of proof collected by the police and the judge gave 20 years in prison to him but now they found the actual offender.However, the guiltless person had to pay off.As a result,it is immoral as the magistrate is also a human being,sometimes he can also make mistakes.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,although it will be a lesson for the masses  yet ,it could be unethical to do so.'",

Even someone hesitates to discuss this subject. I agree with this statement and I will demonstrate why psychological disease is invisible and why people feel disabled when they get sick in mind.  \r\n\r\nSome experts agree that mental illnesses are hard to define by initial observation which is why people could not recognise whether they or their loved ones are sick mentally. Because the study of psychology is pretty new in the industry and has just been studied for the past few decades compared to other medical research. In order to diagnose it, patients have to complete tens of questions and should talk with their doctors for hours. Even though they are diagnosed as sick, in appearance, they look like a normal individual due to the fact that they just feel pain inside which is invisible and unfeelable by others. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, crowds may not look at this illness as a visible disease, but individuals who experienced it, feel pain a lot as same as an injury. Therefore, such patients should be considered as disabled as they are unable to work and study or even live as much as ordinary people. For example, people sick mentally tend to isolate themselves from their friends and family and be incapable of making decisions and feeding themselves. As such, a significant amount of support, care, and time are needed for treatment.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, however, psychological diseases are not considered illnesses in the body such as injury and heart attack, the consequences of this must be accepted as harmful diseases within the community as it is new and hard to identify at first glance.'",

Why is this? Is this a positive or negative trend?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, fresh produce such as vegetables and fruits are frequently transported over vast distances from rural areas to urban centres before reaching consumers. This practice remains a subject of debate. In this essay, I will delineate several rationales behind this phenomenon and provide my perspective.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, rural areas offer optimal conditions for cultivating vegetables and fruits, boasting ample open land and favourable natural environments. Additionally, certain regions specialize in crop cultivation, benefiting from specific climatic conditions conducive to large-scale fruit agriculture. For instance, locales like Da Lat and Sapa are renowned for strawberries and cherries, while hot regions excel in watermelon and durian production. Conversely, urban cultivation faces challenges due to high construction density and air pollution resulting from significant CO2 emissions from various activities like transportation and manufacturing. Although techniques such as vertical farming have been adopted in some urban settings, their output remains insufficient to meet market demands.\r\n\r\nTransporting fresh produce over thousands of miles from rural farms to urban markets presents challenges in maintaining product quality, particularly in adverse weather conditions or on rough terrain. Vibrations during transportation can lead to bruising of vegetables, while delays may cause spoilage or contamination of fruits. Nonetheless, to ensure adequate quantities and high-quality products, this transportation trend must persist. Integration of freezing equipment in transport vehicles can effectively preserve freshness and minimize adverse effects during transit.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while long-distance transportation of fresh produce entails challenges such as weather and road conditions, it remains the most viable means for urban consumers to access quality vegetables and fruits. The fertile soil, clean air, and expansive agricultural lands available in rural areas support this practice, making it indispensable for meeting urban dietary needs.'",

Some argue that physical exercise plays a pivotal role in attaining victory matches. However, it seems to me that substantial power is also a crucial condition for performing well in this field. The following article will clarify both viewpoints.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, those who claim that muscle strength is an indispensable element of attainment in sports are justifiable in many aspects. To commence with, individuals who are more prone to the wellness of muscular and sturdy bones will lean towards the champion in the competition. The fitter an athlete is, the better chance he stands of winning which is proven in such sports as boxing and waist lifting. Additionally, the team with physically agile, and the individual's endurance gains more advantages over the others. As a result, football players and athletics athletes spend a plethora of relentless training time before the match starts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, opinions argue that sportspersons cannot reach the desirable achievement without mental health. Having a confident state during the games will reinforce their beliefs in themselves so that they can make precise decisions in emergency cases and keep calm regardless of pressures before competitors, especially in football and boxing. For another sport like GOFL, composure and intense concentration are a must. These statuses allowed sportspeople to concentrate better, limit mistakes, and make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would argue that both mental and physical strength are vital for players to win a competition.

There are multiple factors that might drive them to make such decisions, which I believe could be detrimental. In this essay, I will focus on the reasons of this phenomenon before moving on to its effects on both sides.\r\n\r\nSuch beauty chasers might have two primary reasons for making changes to their looks. First off, they may lack confidence in their appearance. For example, it is common for some beauty lovers to complain about their noses being too big or their eyes being too small, even if they are fine. This mindset may facilitate them in changing those parts. Another possible reason is to simply have a normal life. This mainly means the soldiers who have lost a part in the war. Those who have been tremendously wounded need cosmetic methods to fix their look.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that such surgery may make people happy and confident, it is harmful most of the time. To begin with, patients may suffer from post-surgery side effects. This is because of the unknown long-term effects of some new technologies, which could be irreversible and take years before emerging. Secondly, those operations may empty their pockets and lower their living standards. Clients may endlessly spend hundreds of thousands on fixing and maintaining their faces, having little budget left for basic needs. Having said that, it is true that such surgery may bring a brighter future for patients such as blind people who would like new eyes installed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the growing number of plastic surgery customers is not a straightforward issue. Perfectionism and medical needs might be the major reasons why people choose to have such operations which may result in sequela and poverty.

I think having a special course for foodstuff is beneficial  for schoolers  owing to growing the number of obese people.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, food is vital for humankind and they have to consume  at least three meals during a day  these intakes are fuel for our body to live, think and also grow. So it is essential to be aware of ingredients and the impacts that they can have on our hygiene state. Additionally, because of the increase in the use of fast foods and junk meals our communities are struggling with the obesity problem also researchers estimated that in the next decades fat population will double. As a result, I believe it is important to tackle this problem and start to make society aware of the effects that our dishes  have on our buddies. For example, the number of fast food shops has increased  dramatically and nowadays this type of meal is easier to access compared  to the past and because of fair prices and fast delivery ,the customers  of in this industry has risen significantly and they are not aware of horrific features of those foods and unfortunately children are the biggest fan and captured a major percentage of this figure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many  necessary majors for students to endure  and putting extra weight on their studies will make them tired in the long term. Moreover, extra lessons need  money and time and these items will make things more sophisticated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the knowledge of meals is vital and to solve this worrying issue governments can consider this lesson as an extra course and  not think about grades and just have it for public awareness to decrease effects and solve obesity problems before they reach  the peak level of danger.\r\n\r\n In conclusion , our consumption will define our health and efficiency so it is advantageous to know about it.

In this essay, we will discuss both points of view and diverge into one opinion.\r\n\r\nThere is an opinion that poverty is strongly related to a criminal. It is evident that the environment affects human beings notably. Economic background is not the only reason that affects individuals, however, it is one of the most reliable features, due to its effectiveness in determining one's environment. People who have negative economic backgrounds tend to reside in low-price areas, which could related to worse morality and higher criminal rates than high-price areas. Thus, economic background could affect one's morality. For instance, there was a TV program in which normal people sneak into the prison, and that show demonstrates the possibility of attendants intending criminals increased drastically.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is clear that in some cases, the environment does not affect one's criminal, but an individual's personality. We showed a lot of examples that some serial killers had grown up in friendly families. Their possibility of being criminals could be observed from a young age, such as abusing animals or a lack of emotional expression regardless of environment.

In order to reduce  meat consumption, in this essay, I will explore some solutions and explain the difficulties that would emerge after applying those solutions. The reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in order to decrease meat consumption due to the limited land sources, it is crucial to inform people of the health risks associated with the overuse of meat. According to the statistics in 2021, 30% of diseases related to high blood cholesterol as well as   high blood pressure are the results of excess meat eating, which is high in fat. So, it seems that cutting down on consumed meat would reduce the number of sufferers from those ailments. Admittedly, showing provoking recipes on TV or social media that substitute soy or other crops like rice or potato for meat while mentioning their benefits could attract meat users to herbal goods, which are both healthy and affordable. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these steps would have negative impacts on communities. Having implemented those rules, a high demand for vegetative products is highly likely to occur resulting in a soar in green food costs. Even more importantly, though, would be a soar in overusing marine food like fish or prawns, which would lead to a significant fall in marine resources for upcoming generations and an imbalance of ecosystems.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I believe that although taking policies to substitute crops for meat is accompanied by some challenges, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks due to the fact that it demands less land and would return to the growth of human health.'",

Others disagree. \r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary world, whether employer should be allowed to get the personal details of employees or not has sparked controversial opinions, with advocates and critics both representing valid arguments. This essay will analyze both perspectives and will subsequently offer a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason that the collection of personal details of employees such as their hobbies, and interests should be acceptable is because it helps the employer to understand the nature and skills of personnel easily. There might be some individuals who might be good sports personalities, this depicts that they may inherit excellent cooperation and coordination skills. Moreover, schedules can be amended as per the needs of people who are married because they have a family to take care of and spend some quality time with them. Thus, if the company knows that they are married then they can be shifted to the nearest office.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, some owners may judge their workers according to the hobbies, and interests they have. This is not an accurate way of judging people. For instance, there are a certain number of adult workers who prefer to drink during the night, and if their owners and co-workers know about that they may judge them inappropriately. Furthermore, some married women can be dominated at work because individuals may think that due to their family pressure, they will not be able to concentrate. Superiors will not give equal importance to married women and single ladies.\r\n\r\nAccording to my viewpoint, judging people through their interests is not relevant. Instead, everyone should be provided equal opportunities to prove their skills and qualifications.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the matrimonials mentioned above, disclosing personal interest in front of the employer has both merits and demerits but in my opinion, it is not useful for the employees to give their details while joining the firms.'",

This essay discusses the reason behind this phenomenon and why I believe this may not be a healthy trend.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why true-crime TV series and books are increasing in popularity these days. Firstly, they usually provide exciting storytelling and unexpected plots. This is because the narrative often involves solving mysteries and, therefore, watchers feel intrigued to know the turn of events. For instance, Dexter's TV show had a huge audience throughout many seasons, due to its interesting plot and excellent casting. Additionally, watchers often feel more motivated to consume crime stories that were inspired by real crimes. This may be due to their curiosity regarding what has happened and, sometimes, after the shock of discovering that the story is real.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, I do not think this genre is good for people's mental health. The reason for this is that it may have a negative psychological effect on watchers' minds. Since many stories are based on real life, individuals can feel shocked and mentally ill after seeing violent and bloody scenes. For example, the recent TV series called The Bear has received many reviews saying that people felt too horrified from watching scenes which made them feel uncomfortable and sometimes depressed. Moreover, consuming too many crime stories may affect individuals' confidence to go out of their homes and attend to their daily routines. This may be due to them losing trust in others since anyone could be a psychopath or a serial killer, for example.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons why many people from different countries are interested in consuming crime stories lately is because of the stimulating scriptwriting and the curiosity of knowing how true crimes have happened. However, in my opinion, crime films and novels should be consumed with caution since they may trigger people's psychological traumas and reduce one's trust in others.'",

In this essay, I will explore the influence of advertisements on individuals and also provide some measures to protect people.\r\n\r\nCompetition over gaining a good reputation for the products and attracting customers from all around the world can pave the way for an increasing number of advertisements. First of all, by advertising they frequently can exhibit the advantages and good qualities of their products by emphasizing the quality and some extraordinary properties of their products. For instance, in my country, there are several diverse advertisements for the same products, each time trying to show new improvements and some other good qualities of the product. Furthermore, there is nothing more persuasive than an advertisement, which can allure people easily to buy the items offered, as it often highlights the positive sides of the products.\r\n\r\nThere are several possible solutions which can be considered as an effective way of protecting customers. To begin with, governments may implement some strict rules and enhance law enforcement regarding advertisements and regulations of sales in the country. To cite an example, they can find the companies which demonstrate their undesirable products as  very good ones and take a penalty from them. Moreover, the laws about the number of advertisements for one product can be restricted and some taxation should be put on the companies that want to advertise. Therefore, due to some expenses, the manufacturers can diminish the number of advertisements they produce.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in order to gain a reputation and myriad customers it is worth advertising, while it also should not be overlooked that the safety of the people is supervised and ensured.'",

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'In today's digital area, mobile phones and the internet play a crucial role  in shaping social interactions. While these technologies bring certain drawbacks like dependency and addiction, this essay agrees that the benefits that they offer such as instant communication and connectivity across distances outweigh the disadvantages because they improve communication in personal lives and business.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, mobile phones and the internet have completely changed the way people communicate, allowing individuals to stay connected regardless of geographical barriers. Social networking platforms and messaging apps enable instant communication, fostering stronger relationships among friends and family members. Furthermore, modern technologies have transformed the way businesses operate and people work. With the rise of remote work, individuals have greater flexibility in managing their personal and professional lives. As a result, this flexibility promotes work-life balance and allows people to pursue their passions or spend more time with their loved ones. For example, that makes it easier for a single parent to take care of their children and do a full-time job.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a major concern that  excessive use of mobile phones and the internet might lead to dependency and addiction, detracting from real-life social interactions and relationships. Some may prioritize virtual connections over face-to-face communication, leading to feelings of disconnection and loneliness, and a decline in mental well-being, especially among younger generations. For instance, in Japan, there are a lot of young people who live online only and hardly ever go outside, which leads to many mental issues, and an increased amount of suicide attempts in their age group.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the impact of mobile phones and the internet on social relationships is multifaceted, with both advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages because the technologies simplify the way people interact with each other.'",

Do you think it is a positive or negative development\uff1f' \n 'Text': 'Certain countries prioritize the construction of specialized facilities to train top athletes over providing sports facilities accessible to the general public. I strongly believe that it is a positive development and my reasons will be presented as below. \r\n\r\nAn advantage of allocating funds towards training facilities for elite athletes lies in their capacity to enhance athletic performance. These facilities are often outfitted with cutting-edge equipment and staffed by expert coaches, thus enabling athletes to attain peak readiness for participation in top-tier international competitions. Consequently, their noteworthy accomplishments can confer honor upon their country, augmenting not only citizens' sense of national pride but also bolstering the nation's image, reputation, and influence on a global scale. For instance, the triumphs of Spain's premier football team contribute significantly to shaping a positive perception of the country on the international stage.\r\n\r\nSome argue that the allocation of funds towards specialized training facilities for top-notch athletes could detract resources from public sporting venues, potentially impacting citizens' involvement in sports. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant role played by top athletes as inspirational figures, encouraging and enabling individuals to participate in sports and adopt an active lifestyle. This phenomenon is exemplified in China, where Olympic medalists and world champions in table tennis have acted as catalysts for the widespread engagement in the sport. Without the positive influence exerted by these esteemed athletes, there might be a lack of motivation among individuals to utilize sports facilities and partake in physical activities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the prioritization of specialized training facilities for esteemed athletes is a positive trend as it ultimately yields numerous conducive outcomes for society as a whole.'",

The more the ailing population in a country, the more the government will have to spend on them for welfare.As an example, in Pakistan, the employees after retirement get a huge sum of pension which is doubled at the age of seventy-five years and often the benefits are given to the families of the deceased.All these expenses are borne by the government which puts more pressure on the earning lot by applying greater tax.In addition, many of these sick individuals are dependent on family members for their physical needs.This means more members of a community are unavailable for active jobs as they are bound to look after debilitated patients.\r\n\r\n                                      To summarize, getting an illness-free advanced age is a blessing for residents who may contribute to nation-building.Overall the merits of increased age outweigh a few of its demerits.'",

As a result, they will be more popular and will replace human positions in the future. For instance, chat GPT is an incredible artificial intelligence with the ability to do difficult tasks like humans such as chatting, creating images and programming. As a consequence, businesses will replace human assistants with chat GPT, making the position for assistant  more competitive and soon replacing businesses.\r\n\r\nThe development of robots will have a negative effect on the employment rate of the area. As  robots become smarter and faster, many people will be unemployed, especially  those who have a low educational background. This will have a profound effect on the country\u2019s economy.

Do you think it is a positive or negative development\uff1f' \n 'Text': 'In order to achieve international success, some countries focus more on building specialized facilities for top athlete training than offering public sports facilities for general citizens. There exists a debate about whether the phenomenon is positive or not. From my perspective, I am inclined to stand neutrally with the phenomenon as both sides are equally important and the government have to figure out a proper distribution of expenditures.\r\n\r\nInitially, one of the main arguments in favour of emphasis on professional facilitates for top athletes is that earning medals in international sports competitions is an effective way to grow national reputations. Therefore, those athletes represent not only their own abilities but also national glories. In addition to their own effort, involving governmental resources will help athletes to excel themselves.Hence,  governmental support plays an indispensable role in athletes' improvements.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, evoking public awareness of the importance of exercise can result in a healthy lifestyle which is beneficial to crowds.Thus, it is crucial to provide sports facilities to citizens so as to promote the merits of  exercise.For example, there are many governmental swimming pools in Tawan which attract the elderly to swim in the morning.It has a positive impact on enhancing physical abilities. According to the aforementioned, sports facilities for general people are essential to build up a healthy society.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, despite the fact that top athletes need authorities\u2019 support in providing specialized factualities,the significance of offering individuals an attractive sports environment cannot be ignored. Thus, the authority should strike a balance between both sides so as to best serve the interests of the public.'",

Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?' \n 'Text': 'One of the most prevalent trends in the contemporary world is the cumulative  increase in smart devices among youngsters. Large companies are developing different strategies and  attract undergraduates. In my point of view, this is a negative development, in which  technology restricts the growth of teenagers\u2019 mental strength. This stance will be proven by carefully analysing how it is not beneficial for students.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, waste of time and fitness issues. The main reason is that teenagers spend time  watching movies , playing games and texting messages to their friends. Another factor is that sometimes they play restricted games, which has negative effects on their mental well-being. For example, those types of pupils suffer from weight gain problems and mental health issues, in the Blacktown Hospital,  New South Wales  a majority of postgraduates admitted, due to anger management issues. No doubt some students benefit from technology with their school work and exam preparation. Some become scientists and doctors because of read from the Internet and used for their career.As a result, it is evident that the excessive purpose of electronic devices is harmful to strength.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, I think, this is a negative development, the primary factor is that tutees waste their time playing video games and  rays emitted by screens damage their eyes. Another reason is that companies attract the younger generation towards the latest gadgets, modern games and comics. For instance, a number of students visited  the Spec Saver to check their eyes and a medical report printed in the year 2023, Herald newspaper was scary, about 20% of younger suffered from  excess use of screen time. As a consequence, it is apparent why scholars are attracted towards new technologies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the analysis of both advantages and disadvantages, it is clear that  the adoption of technology among sophomores is good only if they need it for school work and knowledge instead of highly used for games and chatting, which is dangerous for their health and career. Further, it is predicted that this development is going to continue in the future as well.'",

Some believe that being wealthy is the answer, while others think that living a happy and healthy life with your family is the key. In some cases, people consider that it defines a person to become their best version and reach the highest point they can in their lives. Moreover, it is assumed that it could be seen through someone's academic achievement.\r\n\r\nThe taste of victory that everyone desires to feel develops at an early age of someone, which is impacted most by their environment and society. As children absorb the behavior and attitude of the ones who are often around them, these people's actions and words direct their goals in the future. The mindset and the actions of kids' parents could directly influence the way they think of achievement. For example, if their parents thought that being excellent in the education field is a success, their children tend to grow up assuming the same.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, as societies evolved throughout the years, the population that was in the same eras would have a similar clarity of victory. For instance, in the past, being rich was an accomplishment because enrolling in a university and working in a corporation was complicated, while most of the citizens worked in industries that demanded physical strength.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I consider that living a peaceful and healthy life is a success. Also, it is the definition of looking back into your life and not regretting a single decision. To sum it up, being successful is a choice and does not have a similar meaning for everybody.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'There is ongoing debate regarding the responsibility for instilling social competencies in children to ensure they become valuable members of society. While some argue that this duty lies solely with parents, others, myself included, contend that educational institutions also play a pivotal role. In this essay, I will delve into both perspectives.\r\n\r\nParents are often considered the primary influencers in a child's life. Within the familial environment, children are nurtured and guided, making it an ideal setting for imparting values and moral principles. Parents possess intimate knowledge of their children, enabling them to tailor their guidance according to individual needs. Moreover, the early lessons in obedience, respect, and empathy typically begin at home, laying the foundation for broader social interactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the scope of social learning extends beyond the confines of the home. Schools serve as microcosms of society, providing children with exposure to diverse backgrounds and perspectives. In this communal setting, interactions with peers and educators offer invaluable lessons in cooperation, tolerance, and collaboration. These experiences are integral in shaping a child's social consciousness and fostering a sense of community responsibility.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I advocate for a collaborative approach to social education. Both parents and educational institutions must share the responsibility of molding well-rounded individuals capable of contributing positively to society. While parents provide the initial framework, schools supplement this by offering exposure to diverse perspectives and fostering collaborative skills. By embracing this shared responsibility, we can better equip future generations to navigate the complexities of the modern world and become exemplary members of society.'",

While I agree music is a form of common feelings expression, people who are older or conservative may refuse to understand music from different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe reason why people feel connected with others from various cultures or ages is that despite the language barrier they can  perceive the emotions conveyed by music, such as happiness, sadness or gloom. To be specific, many patterns in melody and rhythms can activate  certain areas in our brains, and therefore we will respond to the music with pleasure or excitement. For instance, when people hear a song with fast-paced speed, they are likely to spontaneously dance to it and enjoy the moment together. That is why Gangnam Style is so popular worldwide.\r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s difficult for the elderly or those who are conservative to understand pop music. They get used to the kind of music they heard when they were young and dislike some new forms of expression like K-pop music. Because of this, those people usually have a generation gap with their children and don\u2019t know how to talk with their younger families.

In my opinion, I believe that the idea of motivating and inspiring students by teachers is completely flawless, but passing on knowledge also can be beneficial in some measures. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, to consider passing on knowledge from teachers to students as a crucial role can be beneficial in various ways. Firstly, It enables children to build up excellent discipline and planning skills. For the purpose of keeping up with the current study program, students must plan a proper schedule to learn the subject appropriately as well as be disciplined in the work of operating those proper schedules. As a result,this can benefit them in later life as they can handle their work by themselves. Furthermore, since they have perfectly acquired the lessons, the ability to memorise that lesson can be boosted significantly. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, motivating and inspiring students to keep up with and be passionate about the lessons does bring several advantages. To begin with, It is acted as a mental healing - method as it predominantly affects the mentality of children, since they are encouraged they might experience feelings of confidence in the long term of the studying process. I, for instance, have felt the feeling of desperation in English, after moving to Australia and receiving encouragement from Australian teachers, currently I can use English fairly in my daily life. Moreover, it can shape attitudes and foster curiosity in students letting them be able to fully learn effectively. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I strongly agree that the main role of a teacher is to motivate and inspire students but to pass students the knowledge can be viewed as a crucial advantage.'",

As it requires frequent purchases, people have already paid a significant amount of money after some time as a whole.\r\n\r\nOne immediate practical solution to tackle ecological and health issues is every nation should introduce and implement a recycling process and technology. For example, some developed countries, including the UK and the USA, have built recycling factories and successfully reproducing new products by those thrown in the bins. The second possible solution to this problem would be persuading and encouraging the residents to use reusable items instead of single-use package deals. Sweden replaced the disposal products with reusable ones.  in many developed countries, such as the UK and the USA, for example. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the environment and inhabitants have deteriorated due to the waste from single-use products, because they are increasingly common in our lives. However, this can be solved by replacing disposable packages with multi-use bundles and implementing a project that reproduces new products made of single-use products. All countries should participate in this project as one body.'",

What are some of these problems, and what solutions can you suggest?' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary epoch, most of the old people are seen living solitary in society. This trend generates various problems like the generation gap and lack of care in old age. Public awareness and understanding of growing age needs are the possible solutions to this trouble.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary problem that is generated in the economy due to this fashion is a rise in the level of the generation gap. It is very common across the nations that after the age of 50 elderly people are sent to old-age homes away from their grandchildren and grandkids never get love from their grand guardians. Old humans start feeling lonely and depressed by being away from their family members. Moreover, aged individuals require more care from their children in mid 50's but they do not get that due to the hectic schedule of their juveniles. They remain stressed all the time due to this they might suffer from a few health problems such as high blood pressure and heart attacks.\r\n\r\nThe most predominant solution to the problem is public awareness. Some campaigns should be advertised to make humans aware of, the need for care that is required by the old people so that they can remain physically and mentally healthy. Youngsters should carefully understand the need for care required in old age. Furthermore, old people can be good caretakers of their grandchildren when their parents are busy at work. This can assist in the healthy growth of their children with love and care. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, if elderly people are left alone the above-mentioned problems can arise in society and they are pernicious to society. Thus, the above-mentioned solutions should be considered carefully.'",

Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether working from home is more beneficial than travelling to work or it should be banned. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that the advantages of working from home are incomparable with drawbacks. The reasons for this are as follows. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that despite the risk of social isolation working from home would lead to a plunge in traffic congestion as well as air pollution. So, working from home could lead to a decline in the amount of carbon footprint. According to the statistics, working from home during the pandemic  Corona-Viruses, reduced the amount of traffic by 50%, and consequently caused a fall in air pollution by up to 30% in 2021. Also, these results lead to a dramatic decrease in ailments related to air pollution like Asthma and lung cancer.\r\n\r\nYet, perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this issue is the convenience for employed parents who tend to have an eye on their children while they are working. Salient examples of this could be computer engineers architects or teachers, who could fulfil their parental tasks alongside professional duties with the help of the Internet and Email . Admittedly, rather than wasting time commuting, people could dedicate that time to their own interests for example exercising or meditating. \r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, although working from home would  lead to some difficulties, I believe that the advantages of working from home outweigh the disadvantages. Thus, taking regulations to institutionalize this method of working from home is likely to contribute to appealing benefits.'",

A group of individuals presented the view that it is better to raise the price of products with high sugar levels to motivate people to eliminate their use of such goods. I strongly disagree with this idea.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that deciding what kinds of food to consume is a personal decision and everyone is responsible for his choice. It is preferable if people would be educated about lifestyle from an early age in schools including, introducing them to how it is beneficial if they eat nutritious foods as well as what the long-term consequences of consuming unhealthy foods are. Therefore, would have sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions to have a healthy diet and they probably avoid eating poor nutrition food such as sugary, salty or fatty foods.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, some individuals claim that raising the prices of sugary foods is going to help decrease their consumption as people, especially the ones who have lower incomes, might not be able to afford to purchase them. However, nothing can justify forcing people to do what they do not like. In this way, they are more likely to reduce their expenditure on other staff even proteins, fruits or other healthy goods to just be able to purchase what they want.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely disagree with the idea of making expensive sugary foods to prevent people from buying and using them.

However, a lot of people still prefer to study in actual classrooms. Both methods have several merits and demerits. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, online education is highly beneficial. First, it is cost-effective as people do not need to spend a lot of money to rent a flat near the teaching institute. Second, it mitigates the educational disparity by enabling people in remote areas to engage in a class. However, not all aspects of this method are favourable. Distance learning causes health degradation. For instance, increased screen time leads to decreased eyesight and concentration. \r\n\r\nTraditional studying is highly beneficial for students because they find it easy to focus on their tasks as they can directly communicate with the lecturers. Moreover, teachers can clearly convey their voice and information, which is crucial to effective education. Nevertheless, traditional learning has several disadvantages. For example, individuals are not able to review the lesson repeatedly as it is not recorded. Furthermore, people feel drained and they waste a lot of time commuting to the classroom every time. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the online education rate has been increasing in recent years.

The people are separated into two groups:some believe that the ageing population is a burden in the community, whereas others think there are advantages to the growing elderly population. This essay will argue that the downsides of a large, ageing population outweigh the benefits.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the elderly always require special care since they do not have the ability to do the daily tasks alone. For example,if they have some diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension, they are required to take their medication on time in addition to feeding well. Therefore, they need to\u00a0\r\n\r\na care provider because their children are workers and have busy lives, so they create a burden.\r\n\r\nAnother drawback is that the majority of the ageing population are not workers and, as a result, are not productive in the community. To illustrate,older people are usually more dependent on the living income of their children because they are not able to work because of their physical health or have a serious disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the advantage of the elderly is that they have sufficient knowledge and experience in life, so they are given good advice and guide their children in the right way. However,I believe that over the years, the young generation will obtain the same experience.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I support the idea that the growth of older people in the population has several disadvantages compared to the increase in the young population since they will be more creative, productive,productive and provide many benefits to society.'",

From my point of view being both sociable and qualified are needed to fulfil most of the jobs nowadays.\r\n\r\nAs far as knowledge and experience are concerned, some jobs do need specialities. For instance, if you want to take the chance to work as a doctor you should have a degree from a university, that you have been trained as a doctor and are qualified. Regarding this issue, the higher the rank of the university you studied in, the more chance you have to get better job offers. Furthermore, being qualified and having experience in a special subject are crucial to some employers and they would not take the risk of inexperienced staff, since it may endanger their credit and respect. \r\n\r\nBeing able to socialize with others plays a pivotal role in everyone's life these days, especially if you want to take a job which is based on this quality.

To what extent are the changes that take place good?\r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.' \n 'Text': 'In the modern world, many researchers claim that youngsters will change their social behaviours in some ways when they experience their lives rather than the development of adults. I think that this change relies on their behaviours instead of the change of age as the life-experiencing of individuals is an essential part of their lives. This essay will expound on my views and conclude the topic.\r\n\r\nTo commence, the majority of the reasons for children's behaviours transform frequently. Children are more likely to reshape their social skills when they have interacted with peers at schools or educational institutions. In this circumstance, children tend to modify their social interactions with different kinds of people to contribute to extending their social circles. As a result, this can benefit them in preparing to be adulthood while adults have well-developed interaction skills in their lives. Therefore, this change is more likely to be affected by their experiences rather than their ages.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, adults and youngsters have many differences in their social behaviour development. One of the major reasons is that mature individuals have more life experience than younger ones so they would not like to change their social behaviours accordingly. According to the study, it is common for mature people to have many ups and downs in life journeys such as studying or working, and this situation tends to build up their interaction with people as well. Hence, adults' social skills are more fully life-experienced and probably do not always shift.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the statement above, I believe that children transform their social behaviours more than adults, and their change relies on life experience instead of age.'",

To fulfill the nutritional demands of this ever-growing society, governments and scientists have to seek a solution. One solution is to employ science to modify crops to have more and higher quality products. This issue has brought a special concern regarding the health and environmental dangers of this kind of agricultural product.\r\n\r\nI would like to start my argument by writing about the benefits of this type of crop. Those people who are in favor of this method argue that by genetically modifying the crops, food production will increase massively by making crops more resistant to pests. Secondly, they believe that by adding vitamins and other minerals the nutritional value of the food will be improved. For example, by modifying the gene that can cause allergy in the peanut, the final product will cause less allergic reaction. Moreover, these changes in genes might keep the products fresh for a much longer period so there will be less waste.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people who are opposed to this concept claim that we do not have enough knowledge regarding the long-term impacts these kind of products have on human health. In addition, this industry has not been able to prove that it is safe for both human beings and the environment. For instance, there is some evidence which reveals that these modified crops might have devastating effects on other plants and wildlife populations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, based on what is discussed above, in my point of view, both arguments are legitimate. In other words, along with the obvious benefits, these products can have irreversible destructive impacts. Accordingly, more long-term studies should be carried out before the spread use in the future.'",

To what extend do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'In today\u2019s fast-paced world, young people are in the face of seeking good jobs. It is a widely held belief that finance is the primary criterion when considering a career. From my perspective, I partly agree with this opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that a lucrative income is of great importance in various aspects of life. In terms of daily expenses, workers who have well-paid jobs may be able to meet their basic demands such as electricity and rent. Furthermore, physical health will also be guaranteed. When approaching older age as well as being exposed to the pollution, individuals can be prone to some kinds of illnesses with ease. Without money, they may find it challenging to get access to medical services. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, a higher salary can contribute to the overall happiness and fulfilment of employees. In fact, there is a saying that \u201cmatter determines consciousness\u201d. In other words, spiritual life will be extremely tedious with a shortage of money as the young who are at their prime, may have an inactive lifestyle and lose confidence instead of exploring new places as well as keeping in touch with their friends. As a result, high income plays a vital role in career pursuit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are various other factors that contribute to an accomplished career including supportive colleagues, work-life balance, and passion for work.

What should be done to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience\r\n\r\nWrite at least 250 words.' \n 'Text': 'In our contemporary society, the phenomenon of the rampant extinction of animal species is one of the gravest and most concerning issues. In the forthcoming paragraphs. this essay will delve into the underlying causes of this problem and provide a reasonable conclusion with possible solutions.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, one of the main reasons for animal extinction and loss of habitat is superhot forest fires. Thus, the effects of climate change are far-reaching and alarming. including fires which can be caused by extensive hot weather conditions. To exemplify. some species can solely survive in certain parts of the world, if they are destructed by fires, they cannot breed and their extinction is inevitable. Furthermore, it is evident that overfishing can result in loss of marine biodiversity and destruction of ecosystems. Hence. some communities try to gain their livelihood through fishing and hunting, but excessive rates of these actions may pave the way for habitat loss.\r\n\r\nThe potential solutions to prevent the destruction of biodiversity in certain parts are manifold and beneficial. Perhaps the eminent examples of this would be the conservation programs which can be provided by the government and individuals can take some steps to mitigate the dire ramifications of poaching. If the particular species are maintained and bred. they can live longer than expected. Moreover, the executive powers should take some measures, including  strict control over the black market and some regulations for excessive hunting activities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this tendency, there is no doubt that human-induced factors can primarily cause the loss of species, while, biodiversity can be protected by merely the help of human societies. Addressing this behaviour requires concerted efforts, diminishing the acute consequences of the decreasing diversity among animals while safeguarding our planet for posterity.'",

Others say that there are more important environmentalproblems.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that the loss of special kinds of animals and plants is the dominant environmental problem nowadays, however, others think some problems are more important than this. In my opinion, environmental problems like the increase in average temperature may be the main problem.\r\n\r\nNumerous people believe the disappearance of lives will pose a threat to the food chain, which may lead to damage to lives. Actually, the food chain plays a vital in nature because it allows every type of animal to obtain enough food. If more and more species are vanishing, many animals may fail to find enough food to survive. For instance, if many kinds of plants die out, it will be difficult for rabbits to survive, and then the eagles will also lose their food. As a result, many animals will disappear and human beings can not live on earth alone. This is the reason why some pay closer attention to the loss of species.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is another point that the loss of soil may be the most important issue. As we all know, we lose amount of soil every year. It is evident that we may not have enough soil to cultivate within several years. When that day comes, people will suffer from the shortage of food and considerable citizens may even die. So someone believes that we should give priority to prevent that case from coming.\r\n\r\nMy view is that the increased temperature is the most serious situation. This thing may lead to a large number of disasters. The ice in the northern and southern poles will become water and the level of the sea will be higher, which may cause damage to many regions that are near the sea. For instance, these areas will be covered by seawater and nobody can live in those places. Many citizens will lose their homes and have no place to live and their properties will be lost, too.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, although the decrease in biodiversity may be responsible for the deaths of animals, the growth of temperature has a worse impact. So I think that can be the main environmental problem.'",

Especially, if their parents are not in good health condition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the majority of the youth generation is choosing to live alone because they want to have a better quality of life.

Consequently, that girl should leave her family and start to live alone.

Over the past few decades, many small fishing villages , where people often struggled to make a living, have been developed into thriving holiday destinations. Many local people have spotted new business opportunities and become entrepreneurs, which has further diversified the economy. With all the hotels, motels, restaurants, shops and other tourist facilities that have been developed, there are now enough jobs for everyone and the general standard of living has greatly increased. \r\n\r\nOn the other. hand, in Venice, the huge popularity of the canals and stunning architecture with visitors from all around the world has had a negative impact on local residents. The growing need for tourism accommodation, places to eat and shops has forced too many people to move from their homes to make room for these new developments.

Discuss both views and give your own opinions.' \n 'Text': 'Many viewers hold divergent opinions on the difference in salaries between large organizations\u2019 leaders and ordinary employees. While it is understandable that many argue that paying directors with considerably higher salaries is inequitable, I hold the view that directors receive high payments to fairly compensate for the responsibilities that heavily affect the companies\u2019 overall performance.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, it is expected that employees should be paid equal amounts of salaries due to their industrious work and the amount of time they spend on such a heavy workload. Practically, they only receive a fraction of their leaders\u2019 earnings. Furthermore, ordinary employees are the ones who bring a leader\u2019s vision into reality. However, the payment system depicts that their positions do not wholly reflect the performance of the company or affect the company\u2019s decision-making process. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, major leaders hold crucial responsibilities, despite fewer working hours and tasks. The weight of these duties can cause a high level of pressure that only experts and professionals can bear. Moreover, not only personal tasks are required, but human management is also one of the core skill sets that directors need to earn. For example, if directors lack the ability to harmonize their teams and resolve mutual conflicts, the employees working under their leadership cannot work with high productivity. In addition, to acquire such levels of skills, major leaders have attained years of experience as well as years of being employees themselves, which reflects their amount of salaries.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that large corporations' directors earn higher salaries due to the stressful nature of work, while ordinary employees receive less money as they only contribute to a smaller picture of the companies.'",

Others feel it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for their qualification.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays,more and more university students intend to learn some subjects differently rather than major only. There is no doubt that it is useful to get in touch with various knowledge to meet the needs of current society. Personally speaking,I completely agree with this point of view and I believe that learning something different could be better than giving all their time for qualification,which can be supported by the reasons as follows.\r\n\r\nFirstly and foremost,when you are a student at university, apparently, you have enough time to complete the tasks of the main subjects. For most students,however,even more than 80% of freshmen just spend less than 40% of their time and attention on studying what they need to learn. Oppositely,Their spare time be used to play video games or just hang out daily.secondly ,Learning  some different subjects not only contributes to making sufficient use of their time  but also brings numerous benefits to them. To be more specific,getting new skills,for example, doing some manuscript or medical skills can substantially enhance the quality of their work and daily life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that some practical knowledge can't be learned by paying attention to the book only. For instance,  communication skills are indispensable after you graduate from college. You couldn't express your mind correctly ,thus , causing an uncomfortable work experience without it What 's more, a string of abilities can't also learned from the paper only,such as emotion control, way to use working applications and so on. According to the annual report of  the Australian government, almost 70% of employers believe that there is a solid relationship between individual ability and learning from others.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that learning about different things rather than the main subjects only is necessary for a student's career as well as daily life.In this case,parents and employers should give some tips or advice to address the importance of it, and the university should work to further improve the ability to learn outside.'",

However, this essay agrees that improving people\u2019s lives should be the priority of scientific research. Limited resources available for conducting scientific studies and the poor quality of life of people living in third-world countries are the biggest reasons why scientific studies should be focused on improving people\u2019s lives.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, scientific studies require a lot of valuable resources, and these resources are very limited. To explain in detail, any research requires a good amount of money to pay to the scientists and all other related expenses. Since this money comes from the taxes that people pay, it should be used in a way that can benefit humans. Therefore, it is very important that these funds should be utilized towards those studies that strictly focus on eliminating the problems that humans face.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many people in third-world countries do not have a basic standard of living. For some people in these countries, it is hard to find clean water to drink, enough food for survival and a good place to live in. When many people around the world can\u2019t fulfil very basic needs for food, water and shelter, the most necessary objective of science should be to find cost-effective technologies to make sure that people can fulfil their basic needs for survival.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although scientific studies which focus on making effective ammunition for war are somewhat beneficial to the country, the primary objective of scientific research should be to improve the quality of life of people because humans have limited resources available to use for scientific studies and the very basic problems of the world like not having hygienic food, water and shelter for many people are yet to be solved.'",

It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. \r\n\r\nto what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?' \n 'Text': 'It is undeniable that excessive consumption of fast food is associated with various health problems, and in some regions, the number of populations confronted with those issues is rising. This is the reason why many people suggest that it is crucial for authorities to raise a tax rate on this kind of diet. I personally agree with this viewpoint for many reasons, as described in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, higher taxes on fast food can lead individuals to deter their food choices and eat healthier alternatives. By increasing the price of fast food, people may be more careful to consider healthier options that offer more nutrition. This can have a positive impact on their overall well-being, reducing the risk of health-related issues such as obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Additionally, this can help individuals maintain their productivity and avoid any problems caused by fast food-related ailments. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, higher taxes on fast food can generate additional income that can be utilized to benefit the public in numerous ways. This extra money can be used towards healthcare facilities, ensuring that citizens have access to quality medical services. Education programmes can be provided to raise awareness regarding health issues. Moreover, the fund can be allocated for expanding the number of public parks, offering more active spaces for the people, promote the healthier and overall well-being of  society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the imposition of higher taxes on fast food is a necessary and beneficial step to address the health problems associated with overeating. It not only encourages people to consume healthier food but also provides funding to improve public facilities. By that, the governments can support  creating a healthier society and reducing health issues related to fast food consumption.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is widely believed that studying in an offline class brings more effective benefits than studying online, although online courses are becoming popular nowadays. In my opinion, I agree with people who choose to have an offline class in school instead of an online class at home for two main reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, learning online may affect a learner\u2019s health, especially children\u2019s vision. Prolonged exposure to computers or smartphones causes blood flow to decrease, increases the risk of heart diseases, and leads to nearsightedness due to blue light from screens. Furthermore, online education can contribute to a decline in teaching quality. Lack of control from teachers, students can be distracted by their personal activities, so they cannot focus on their lectures. Consequently, this may bring about a decline in education quality, thus impacting the country\u2019s development. \r\n\r\nIn contrast,  traditional classes make learners concentrate more on their lessons.  With minimal distractions of phone calls, messages, and social network notifications, traditional classes enhance the effect of learning. Therefore, it can grow the effect of learning. Besides that, offline classes may build up human communication better than online classes. They either create an interaction between teacher and their student or between students and students, for instance, they can get lunch together to socialise and open up to each other, therefore getting in-person interaction. As a result, it promotes the development of social skills through communication.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, studying with a group of students in a classroom brings more positive benefits to learners than online classes.'",

What are the causes of this trend and what are the effects on society?' \n 'Text': 'As our world is continuously evolving, in some countries, the populations tend to choose to live alone or in small nuclear family units. In my opinion, this trend can be attributed to the financial instability among the young, and as this issue continues to develop, it could have some negative effects on society, namely that people will become more distant. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, individuals choosing not to live as a large family or choose a solitary life could be the result of financial instability. Simply put, while our living standards are increasing over time, the price for basic needs in life such as electricity and gas bills also skyrocket, to the point one cannot save much money to afford a large apartment. Thus, they have to pick an affordable flat, which normally would not provide enough space for a large family. Taking Hanoi as an example, with the standard salary, rent would accumulate for almost half of it, hence renting or purchasing a large house for an extended family would rarely be considered.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this trend could result in some detrimental impacts on society, such as it could make people become more distant from each other. This is due to the fact that, in order to become financially stable, citizens have to work diligently, which in turn will shorten their free time. As a result, parents have less time to spend with their children and can only do limited work to take care of the elderly. For instance, in many families, the previous generation works day and night to ensure that their kids have a carefree childhood, while kids require attention and affection from their parents. This could create misunderstanding, and in time, a massive rift between the two generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, financial instability accounts for many individuals choosing a lone life or small family units, and this could leave a mark on society, as citizens could be prone to be callous and indifferent.'",

If teachers provided adolescents with practical experience, they would be able to realize how some facts work in reality.

If students are immediately explained some theory facts in practice, they demonstrate an effective understanding of doing tasks in the future, for example, at work.

This writer\u2019s essay will present that these tools are worked by artificial intelligence and play an important role in society.\r\n\r\nFirstly, robots and artificial intelligence are the reasons why they can replace people working because they can work automatically and independently when they start to run. Because of this, robots and other technological devices work more effectively, correctly and faster than humans. In addition, these intelligences have the ability to fix problems when they are working.

What will be the effect if children are not taught history?' \n 'Text': 'Some individuals believe that learning about history is not essential in this globalization. This essay will delve into the reason why we need to be aware of the past, and its potential further effect when youths do not consider about importance of history. \r\n\r\nTeaching about the past is important because children need to understand  their ancestors' history and  values. This gives them inspiration that would help them to reach their further achievement successfully when they face challenges. For example, In Mongolia, our older generations suffered from harsh times in the past, such as poverty and wars, even though those heroes inherited this peaceful country that has vast land. Without our ancestors, the country that we live in does not exist. Therefore, children at least need to learn about their ancestor's history and protect their values, as it would be motivation for the youngsters, and it would be a chance gain experience from their past history. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if children do not know about their history, they cannot be competitive in this modern world. This is because almost every field of social debate is focused on  historical knowledge, which is more important in this fast-developing era. For instance, in Mongolia, many employers ask for historical information when they hire  new staff. It is generally believed that having knowledge about the past means that fundamental education was fulfilled well. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, researching  history can lead to understanding  our elders' challenges that faced in the past and it helps to reach achievements when youths meet obstacles.

Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.' \n 'Text': 'One of the most prevalent trends in the contemporary world is the cumulative decreasing death rate due to the modern medical systems available in different countries. While some people argue that seniors are a burden on the Government's infrastructure, others believe that elderly people teach us their experiences. This stance will be proven by carefully analysing why the older population are good for society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, health and economic issues. The main reason is that these people get sick quickly sometimes due to slight changes in weather and it becomes very difficult to carry them to the hospitals. Another factor is that it is an unnecessary burden on the State to organise beds and food. Furthermore, if elders live long they will get a pension, which is an economic loss for the nation. For example, in Australia some seniors are living alone in their houses and Telstra installed panic buttons, even for small health issues they press the button and engage ambulance staff members. As a result, it is evident why Australia\u2019s health system is busy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, guidance and looking after the children. The primary factor is that pensioners  always share their experiences with their children, so they can make the right decisions in the future. In addition, these humans look after their grandchildren and play with them. Furthermore, some families are unable to afford childcare expenses for their juniors so, these people look after them. For instance, in India people live in joint families  working people go to work and seniors look after houses and toddlers.

Do you think it is a positive or negative development ?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary times, several nations prefer to build various specialised sports infrastructures to train their elite athletes rather than provide public ones to their citizens, which helps them to gain global achievements. This essay attempts to shed light on the merits and demerits of this trend before concluding that I am in favour of the latter notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why country authorities subscribe to establishing special training centres for their professional athletes. First and foremost, it could enhance countries' images. For example, with carefully prepared practice, skilled sportsmen could take part in international competitions as well as achieve high positions, which could allow the participants to introduce their countries and cultures to the public. Furthermore, investments in modern sports facilities could help the country's economy. This is because they are basic and compulsory requirements to organise famous international sports events such as the Olympics and World Cup, which could attract millions of visitors to travel to that country, thus, earning huge profits from accommodation, transportation, and event tickets.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons why I am convinced that the government's focus on developing special sports buildings might bring some profound drawbacks to each household and the entire society. One rationale is that it could decrease the quality of inhabitants' lives. For instance, an increase in the budget for expensive projects means a lower allocation for public sports sites, which might lead individuals to lose their workout habits and face serious health problems. Another justification is that the enormous costs incurred to build gigantic facilities could put a strain on government coffers, thereby leading to budget deficits, tax hikes, or reduced social welfare. As a result, ordinary citizens, especially the underprivileged, might struggle even more to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that the establishment of professional sports infrastructure might have advantages to certain extents, I would contend that the downsides of this phenomenon are more significant.'",

In addition, hardcover books are not easily available due to transportation from the cities. For instance, physical books take time to reach from Australia to India due to courier issues. As a consequence, it is apparent why book lovers like to read on their gadgets.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the analysis of hardcover, you cannot ignore it because it contains our cultural values, however, online readings are always good because they are cheap and easily accessible to access such as 24 hours and 7 days. Further, it is predicted that this development of online and offline reading is going to continue in the future as well.'",

What are the different advantages in each decision?' \n 'Text': 'Passionately, school leavers now have the tendency to start their early careers with large companies which are devised by themselves. Unlikely, some others want to begin with small companies. In this essay, I will further discuss how these two biases can be beneficial to youngsters. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, starting their first job in a big corporation can positively affect teenagers in various measures. Firstly, they have a chance to encounter working multitasks and a wide scope of experiences. As a result, these factors can boost the ability of being a multitasker in youngsters. Secondly, youngsters can gain enormous experiences. As they proactively take action in creating their company, directly exposed to a broad range of experiences. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance,  once said that before he founded  Facebook, he had made plenty of software that gave Mark experience as well as fostered him to be versed in creating software.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, working for a small company also has several advantages. To begin with, youngsters can enhance their agility and flexibility in their work. As small companies mostly have less bureaucracy, they are able to agilely finish their work in certain working conditions. In Addition, it helps people to improve their ability to work in a community or group of people. To cite an example, since youngsters  take orders from the leaders, they have to cooperate on tasks as well as properly implement the work together in order to get the best result.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo sum up, starting their first job in a big corporation or working in a small company  can be beneficial for teenagers in diverse ways.'",

What can be done by parents and teachers to reduce it?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, the number of crimes that youngsters are involved in has been increasing, because of violent TV shows and movies which adversely affect the youth\u2019s attitudes and behaviours, and also parents\u2019 attention to their children has flown these days due to their busy work schedules. There are a number of solutions to tackle this problem, including controlling what your kids watch and lessening family time.\r\n\r\nMovies and shows that frequently show allegations and fights have become increasingly popular among young people as such adolescents threaten others shown in the movies and bully someone who looks weak. These actions then could lead to a rise of criminal levels within the community. In addition to that, parents no longer pay attention to their youths as they have to make money to cover the costs. In consequence, young folk are surrounded by wrong crowds who persuade them to do illegal actions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn order the reduce the violations by adolescents, teachers and parents should work together and set sophisticated educational programs and proper communication methods between them to exchange information instantly. Moreover, with applications and other platforms, parents can remotely manage and control the video streams and time that their children are watching which helps their children away from unwelcome influence from third parties. For example, if children behave improperly, helping to let them know their bad attitudes and involving them in community service to assist people are more effective approaches because they acknowledge their positive contribution to people.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the number of youngsters who have done illegitimate actions has increased over the several period. This is due to the fact that negative influences of social media and streams and less family time. Limiting their screen time and appropriate encouragement by the teachers and parents can solve this issue.'",

Governments could better spend this money on other things to benefit the nation.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some people believe that investments in space projects are a waste of money. For these people, the money of taxpayers should be spent in other areas to bring more benefits to citizens. I agree with this point of view and this essay will explain the reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the budget of the government is finite and it is not possible to invest in all fields at the same amount and at the same time. As a consequence, public authorities have to make choices and define priorities. So, in my opinion, investments in subjects such as poverty and health, for example, are more important, from the perspective of the population, than sending a new rocket to the Moon or to Mars. Furthermore, there are several urgent problems like climate change and global warming to be addressed as soon as possible. As the sources of money are limited, the government should make decisions to help more people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt that researches in space exploration bring some improvements in technology and innovations. There are many examples of new products developed due to the massive investments in the exploration of the universe. For instance, we can cite spirographic pens, microwave ovens, and satellite communication. Another good example is the huge evolution of computers in the last decade.\r\n\r\nAll in all, to conclude, I think that despite the investments in space exploration bringing some advantages, there are other areas much more urgent to invest the money of people. As mentioned before, elimination of poverty and environmental issues should be the priority.'",

There are several reasons why obesity has happened significantly, especially in recent times. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss in detail the cause and effect of obesity itself.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, obesity occurs in every part of the world due to the lack of information about some preventive ways to avoid this issue. The main causes of obesity are eating a lot of unhealthy foods including fast and junk foods, drinking sweet drinks, and not exercising regularly. Moreover, another discovery is that many children and teenagers gain excessive weight these days. This case is happening because of the lack of parental attention in terms of what kind of foods and drinks their children consume every day. Additionally, parents are not giving a friendly reminder to their children about the danger of consuming a lot of harmful dishes, as well as sugary drinks.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, being overweight will make the possibility of a few health diseases bigger than before. For instance, diabetes, heart attack, and even death will happen because of obesity that a person suffers. Besides health problems, there are also mental issues that are caused by gaining too much weight, such as depression, anxiety, overthinking, etc. Both types of problems, I believe, are very important to know for people who are suffering from obesity to pay more attention to them. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, being overweight is a common thing that everyone has to be aware of since its effects are very serious and dangerous at the same time.'",

Discuss views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'These days, there are many different types of sports being played. Many of them are played individually and some of them are played in teams. I firmly believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial than individual sports. This essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my opinion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, playing in a team excites us in several ways. Team members are always cheerful and supportive throughout the game and we all have experienced that if an individual player from the team scores a goal or hits a home run, the rest of the team members start celebrating that moment. For example, I saw a cricket match recently where one team was not performing well and suddenly, all their team members started cheering each other. In the end, they won that match in an unexpected way! Furthermore, if we talk about spectators, most of them like to watch team sports like baseball or rugby rather than individual sports like tennis or badminton.\r\n\r\nHowever, individual sports on the other side are boring. If a game is tough, it is very difficult for an individual to remain calm and be self-motivated which makes it more difficult for them to concentrate. There is not enough guidance for that individual during the game if they are facing a complex time which makes the game look boring. For example, I was watching a tennis match and I noticed that the person playing the game was frustrated and wasn't able to compete. On the other side, I saw a football match where all the team members celebrated every single goal scored by their fellow team members.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that playing in a team has many benefits like motivation, celebration, constant guidance and fair competition among the team. While on the other side, individual sports are more serious, boring and time-consuming which bores viewers as well.'",

This essay discusses some possible reasons why some individuals feel this way and what other aspects of life contribute to one's contentment.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why people think having monetary power can lead to a happier life. Firstly, wealthy individuals have financial freedom. This is due to them being able to comfortably pay for their basic needs and luxury items without having to worry about their finances all the time. In particular, people who receive higher amounts of money tend to travel more regularly, as well as, purchase the latest goods in the market. Additionally, being wealthy often means having a better life quality. To be more precise, people who have monetary resources in abundance usually have high-quality nutrition, live in safer neighbourhoods, and can afford better health treatments, if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other aspects are crucial to one's happiness. The first of these is regarding people's relationships. This is because humans are social animals, and therefore, one of society's basic needs is to have constant social interactions. For instance, recent studies have shown that wealthy people are more susceptible to depression due to poor relationships and loneliness, making them in need of constant psychological treatment. Moreover, participating in charity activities is something that increases people's overall life contentment. This is because helping others in poor conditions can bring a sense of usefulness to individuals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons why owning a lot of money increases people's happiness are due to financial freedom and having better life quality. However, other aspects also contribute to individuals' contentment such as personal bonds and being active in society's charity programs.'",

Some people believe that protecting animals with the help of countries and individuals would be the best option, whereas others argue that dealing with the main issues of people is more essential rather than animals. Personally, I completely believe that we should preserve and take care of nature, otherwise, the world might be a worse place to inhabit.\r\n\r\n   On the one hand, a growing number of people think that they should have several major responsibilities in order to protect the species from danger because they play a significant role in the lives of people. Moreover, some types of animals help people to create and develop the study of medicines. For instance, some burgeoning countries are trying to find a way to alleviate the number of diseases and deaths. Therefore, they need to look after endangered animals and generate specific places such as Zoos to live there. The government is not only supplying animals with a place but also with such environment in which they used to reside here. As an example, polar bears are animals which dwell in cold areas like Antarctica but today, there are some challenges because of changing climate conditions and melting ice caps and glaciers. All human beings should become in one community in order to find better opportunities for such animals.\r\n\r\n   On the other hand, approximately 45% of people feel that the problems of human beings should be taken into account by countries and organizations. Nowadays, there are a multitude of people who suffer from deathful illnesses and do not have any cash in order to meet their needs. For this circumstance, improved countries should provide poor countries with an array of treatment and medicines. In addition, the government and wealthy individuals should invest money in study and food. In such a situation, the government should increase awareness of providing financial aid. As you know, there are several large charity organizations which are introduced the society to help those who are really in need. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, opinions may differ as some people focus on the issues of the extinction of animals by providing them with appropriate places and not hunting them, while others feel that it is the better option that concentrate on the concerns of the public by creating charitable organizations.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is argued that well-developed countries should provide  a shelter for a larger number of refugees and help them by providing the basics like provisions and accommodations. This essay totally agrees with this statement because nations with strong economies have highly efficient agriculture and expertise in building short-term residences and others.\r\n\r\nRich countries have plenty of institutions specializing in harvesting and machinery that are focused on problems of food production scaling. A huge amount of money is being spent on improving the process of farming and the quality of goods. A technical park involved in this stream is always in a state of evolution as well. Thus, it becomes possible to increase the production of food in each stage smoothly to fulfil demands. For example, Germany accepted more than two million people in the last decade, and food shortages were not noticed by locals.\r\n\r\nAlongside harvesting, the experience in construction work is immense as well. To support the dwelling needs of gradual population growth, the government has to be agile in providing accessible housing. The process of building such living areas is constant, and it leads to the invention of new approaches and enhancements by providing affordable facilities quickly. For instance, Poland, the United Kingdom, and others are able to assemble huge territories with corresponding structures in a short period of time to respond as fast as possible to the rapid displaced people flow.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do believe that mature economies are already capable of helping people deprived of their motherland, whether it is food supply or residence-related issues.'",

It not only provides the  materials but saves hours and labour as well.For example,in the traditional method, during  exams , first teachers have to sort out sheets then they have to check sheets individually which consumes so much time for results.On the other hand, with digital machines, instructors just need to scan the sheets and can check and get the results instantly.Hence, electronic devices save a lot of time and energy.\r\n\r\nShifting towards the final view, it cannot teach discipline and can exploit pupils as well.To elaborate on it,machines can teach calculations but not discipline.Only tutors can be taught the regulations and life lessons.In devices, one can only feed data but children cannot share their problems with them.Moreover, there are also fake websites which are not good for young minds and even though pressing one wrong button can lead to those websites.Also, computing devices could  affect eyesight.Spending a lot of hours on screen can make their eyesight weaker.It can be addicting too.For instance, According to a 2022 Indian survey which was conducted by the Education Department it is found that 48% of school-going learners have weak eyesight and it all started during 'The COVID-19 stage when they started studying online.The ratio was increased from 22% to 45%.As a result, electronic machines are not advantageous at certain times.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,although information processing machine saves hours and energy and provide outcomes fast yet ,I largely believe that professors are an important aspect of the field of teaching.'",

Presently, it is a major problem to accumulate enough wealth for old age to live in a comfortable condition. I, therefore, attempt to outline some possible solutions that can be measured by the government.\r\n\r\nA reduction in tax for those who have less competitive salaries would help them save up more money. Complaining about the high amount of tax payments, people give up a certain percentage of their income to the state. However, it might be fair enough to divide a community into different classes on the basis of their earnings. To be more precise, a tax increase for affluent society members would compensate for any drainage for poor families. For example, the tax policy in the Netherlands works in a way that those who earn more than a certain annual salary should pay more than half of it to the government. This undoubtedly could help impoverished individuals manage their financial difficulties with greater ease or even save some money for their future. \r\n\r\nIn addition, education can play a significant role as a game changer in different aspects. Firstly, by improving people's awareness of financial strategies, less money would be spent on unimportant products, which is a result of a prevalent phenomenon among consumers called impulse buying. Also, a knowledgeable society would often invest in shares and assets that could be helpful for them in the future. On the other hand, a noticeable proportion of states' money is spent on jails and prisoners. Having been taught and educated about the moral issues or the retributions of criminals, teenagers tend to maintain law-abiding behaviour throughout their lifetime. As a consequence, there would be fewer people in prison, which subsequently raises the government's wealth and allows it to invest in somewhere else that could be beneficial for those in need.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would argue that states are capable of taking effective steps to help people make enough money so that they could be able to save funds for the elderly period. Classifying society based on their possession and managing the tax system would be in favour of both the country and destitute people. Moreover, the proliferation of valuable courses teaching individuals, especially children and teenagers, leads to a fall in government spending on unnecessary items.'",

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages.' \n 'Text': 'Due to technological advancements, many people nowadays prefer to watch television, movies, and other entertainment alone. Certainly, such a predilection has advantages and disadvantages. Though this approach has many advantages, I feel the disadvantages outweigh them. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the issue and explain why I believe in the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is evident that insular watching provides the most comfort since you do not have to haggle with anybody to select which film to watch or because you can pause, turn up, or turn down the sound at your leisure. This implies people are more inclined to select programming that is customized to their preferences. Moreover, viewing television alone gives you more flexibility. Also, some introverts find it difficult to conceal their inner feelings in front of large groups of people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the disadvantages are pertinent to severe social connection interference. Spending more time alone can reduce your communication capacity and weaken your bonds with family members, friends, and acquaintances. We used to watch leisure shows together, critique them, and laugh together in unison. As a result, new spectra are created and made available for future discussion. We are now less inclined to begin a conversation and are becoming unprecedentedly averse to engaging in any discussion. If this problem continues to afflict our contemporary culture in the long run, the consequences will be extremely difficult to predict.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, while watching films alone can provide individuals with complete ease, the drawbacks it brings are equally horrendous. To prevent this, we should balance personal and social time by replacing family time with alone time.'",

Supported by information technology development nowadays, millions of eyes can watch it through various kinds of electronic devices, such as television that takes the biggest part or mobile phones as individual portable devices. This phenomenon was exposed by businesses to take part in terms as sponsors for certain favourable sports to promote their goods or services through commercial marketing. Collaboration between the enterprises with sports would have mutualistic symbiosis, such as the enterprises could provide funding for specific competition or federation that would improve the sport's quality, in return they can put massive promotions for their business. At the same time, it is possible if the corporations potentially have bargaining power to control specific kinds of sports.\r\n\r\nFirstly, sports could offer benefits to the business through promoting their products broadly. It would help the company's performance and also strengthen its brand to the customer. Some sports that aforementioned have a wide range of fanatic supporters or iconic athletes that facilitate the enterprise to sell their products easily. If the corporation gets a higher return from giving certain sponsorship, most likely it will invest more in the long term and potentially become an exclusive partner. Funding  given by the businesses can be used by the association to improve the sport's development.\r\n\r\nHowever, a higher level of dependency between specific types of sports to a certain donor potentially brings out risk, for instance, the sponsor asking for a special request for broadcasting or a monopoly for athlete appliances. It could reduce the sport's exclusivity since they have controlling power to implement specific requirements that are related to their interest. It would create a negative impact if it is not correctly handled, since sports were selling entertainment to the fans and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFinally, I believe that collaboration between sports and corporations could offer higher benefits for each other since the businesses provide funds for sponsorship and sports could bring their supporters as potential customers for the corporations. On the other hand, sports fans and stakeholders need to maintain their independence as entertainment channels even though they were funded by specific parties to keep their inclusivity.'",

This phenomenon has both positive and negative effects, and it's important to consider them carefully. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this movement from rural to urban areas.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, moving to the city can bring new opportunities. Cities usually have better schools and more jobs, so people who move there may have a chance to get a better education and find better-paying jobs. Also, cities are often more exciting places to live with lots of things to do, like going to concerts, museums, or sports events. This can make life more interesting and enjoyable for those who move from the countryside.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some downsides to this trend. As more people move to cities, they become more crowded, and some problems like traffic and pollution can become worse. It may also be harder for people to find affordable housing in cities, especially if they don't have a lot of money. Moreover, when people leave rural areas, it can mean fewer customers for local businesses, which can hurt the economy in those areas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the movement of people from rural areas to cities has its pros and cons.

Both sides of this topic will be carefully analysed before constructing an inference.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, more free time and less money, the main reason is that if you have excess  time you can utilise it with  family and community welfare. No doubt, you can make good friends and take part in events. Another factor is you can relax at your home and look after your health.

As a result, it is evident that meeting with  different ethnics mankind will bring you more opportunities in their lives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, more wealth and less time, the primary reason is that you will earn more revenue for your family, so they can buy luxury things. In addition, if you are wealthy , it will give you internal satisfaction and you can use extra money to buy more properties for your upcoming generations, so they may not face any difficulties in the future.

In my opinion, if you have money you can enjoy any time, so more money and less time is good for  humans. Furthermore, it is predicted that this development is going to continue in the future as well.'",

Do you agree or\r\n\r\ndisagree?' \n 'Text': 'One of the most recent trends in today\u2019s world is the upsurge in watching a growing amount of violence in media, and it is having negative impacts on youngsters\u2019 routines. There is a wild split of belief that this is a popular subject of debate.  In my perspective, this has more negative than positive impacts and I will demonstrate it with the reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, critics may point out some drawbacks. They might say that even children need to be updated about the ongoing situation in a country. For example, who are studying such as logic, sociology and political science, it is vital to learn about violence, and crime to enhance their education. Most of the time they are learning by doing research therefore it helps them to know those things.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are number of arguments in favour of my stance. Mainly, the children are usually interested in doing experiments. For example, Seeing those programs on television might inspire trying those things and due to hectic lifestyles, parents are also not aware of them. That is the most preponderant one, and it has several consequences in various ways. Secondly, childhood is the stage of beginning to explore things in their life. As an example, if they see good programs such as mind-relaxing, educational or religious their behavior will be good as well. Never will they be aggressive.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the whole world is focusing on educating teenagers to watch meaningful programs to make their future successful. In my opinion, the whole world is focusing on educating teenagers to watch meaningful programs to have good behaviour.\r\n\r\nGiven the arguments outlined above, one might conclude that, despite having certain negatives, the positives of watching meaningful programs on television are indeed too dire to ignore.'",

Do you agree or disagree.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, it is inevitable that developed technology has transformed human behaviours, such as the way people get trustworthy data. Some proponents positively believe that all news is going to be available only online rather than printed out papers. From my point of view, I strongly see eye to eye with the opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, cutting-edge technology, a new phenomenon method, completely facilitates people to get new information more easily than before. This situation has been assisted by the internet, which has been integrated perfectly with the mobile phone, an omnipresent gadget. For instance, over 85% of citizens in Indonesia feel like looking for information using this tool rather than reading a newspaper or printed book due to its impeccable accessibility. Therefore, people can grasp an opportunity to broaden their horizons more conveniently by employing technology.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the government must undoubtedly consider the environmental issues that come about when a newspaper has to be produced frequently. For example, based on the data from the Natural Protection Organization of Indonesia, cellulose is not a sustainable ingredient; one plant can only utilize approximately 100 grams of the substance. Meanwhile, producing one book requires over 50 grams of cellulose. Consequently, a formidable habitat issue is going to have a paramount impact on human life.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I individually contemplate that there will be two factors in all information being posted online for all residents. They are the advanced facilities that are a dime a dozen in society, and the environmental challenges when the companies still convert a plant to paper.'",

There remains some disagreement as to whether it is a positive or negative development. While there are valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that there are more crucial issues like education as well as the environment to be prioritized. The reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, evident is the fact that neglecting education, which nurtures specialized workforces would pose some challenges in the process of manufacturing. A salient example of this is Japan, as its concentration on education, has enabled it to rank first in producing the most prominent products for global markets. Thus, rather than paying attention to quantity, emphasizing education could lead to manufacturing superior goods in the long term.\r\n\r\nSecondly and even more importantly should be preserving the environment and saving it for the upcoming generations. it is obvious that having produced a high quantity of goods, which entails harnessing natural resources, the depletion of natural resources is likely to occur. Taking Africa as an example, deforestation for industrial purposes, extracting from mines and overfishing have disrupted the natural ecosystem significantly. So, prior to producing any further material, valuing bringing up educated individuals and assessing geographical capabilities should be compulsory.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, valuing  education as well as the environment as valuable assets is crucial for achieving higher production. Whereas, putting excessive emphasis on such superficial issues like numbers or quantity would undermine the authenticity of the producer country and disrupte the ecological order.'",

Those equipment are upgraded and their skills becoming more advanced, as a result, their ability to work in adult positions is becoming more possible. Some hard and repetitive work such as packing or organizing can simply be done by machines. For example, nowadays the majority of companies (Amazon online shop) use robots for moving products in storage and it is completely beneficial and effortless, additionally, increases productivity and reduces potential risks.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some jobs are sensitive and need human knowledge and also need a sense of feeling and ignoring  individual aid will have catastrophic consequences.

It is completely agreed working from residence is time-saving and beneficial for the environment. Both sides of this topic will be carefully analysed before constructing an inference.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, more screen time and missing face-to-face meetings. The main reason is that when working from  home, staff must be present in front of the screen, which damages our eyes and brain. Another factor is that employees miss all personal interactions, where they get knowledge from their office people. For example, recently a report printed in the Herald newspaper,  showed that 25% of people suffered from stress and obesity. As a result, it is evident that people are opposed to working from flats.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, saves time and cleans the environment. The primary reason is that professionals do not need to get ready early for the office, instead they can utilise that time for personal tasks. In addition, less traffic and savings on fuel and travel expenses, such as fewer commuters using public and private transport   as a result,  will reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For instance, the New South Wales environmental department measured the smoke level in the year 2021 and found a clean air level. As a consequence, companies encourage their engineers to work from home , so they can save on office expenses.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the analysis of both sides, it is clear that working from home is best for mankind and companies, where they can save time and money, however working men and women lose their confidence and knowledge which they get from their mates.

I completely concur with this view as local travel is accessible, more cost-effective, and sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for my agreement is domestic tourism is becoming increasingly accessible and appealing. As infrastructure within a country improves and the tourism industry grows, tempting domestic destinations are being developed and promoted. For example, a new high-speed railway in Laos has cut travel times from the capital to the tourist mecca of Luang Prabang down to 3 hours, from a full-day bus journey previously.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my positive view the cost of travelling domestically is often cheaper than travelling internationally. This is especially true when factors such as exchange rates and airfares are taken into account. With the economy in many countries still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are looking for ways to save money on vacations, and choosing to holiday within their own country is an effective way to do so.\r\n\r\nMy final supporting argument is the trend towards sustainable tourism is also likely to drive more people towards domestic holidays. Choosing to vacation within one\u2019s own country has a smaller carbon footprint than travelling internationally, and is, therefore, more environmentally friendly. As more people become aware of the importance of sustainability, they are likely to choose domestic holidays over international ones in order to reduce their impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my view, it is crystal clear that in the future, more people will choose to go on holiday within their own country rather than travelling abroad. With the increasing accessibility and appeal of domestic destinations, the cost savings of domestic travel, and the trend towards sustainable tourism, it is only natural that residents will choose to explore the beauty and attractions within their own borders.'",

Contemporary technology in teaching is very convenient and time-saving for students as well as for teachers.

Firstly, through the conventional method, it is very difficult for teachers to explain  complex topics to students. But, after the advent of new audio-visual technology, it is very easy to explain tough topics with the help of animations. Additionally, since most educational institutes have adopted online teaching, students can easily learn from anywhere in the world, which is very convenient and time-saving. \r\n\r\nDespite these advantages, there are many drawbacks of new technologies which not only affect the learning curve of students, but it affects the overall health of pupils.

While some would argue that it is totally inappropriate, others believe that it helps kids obtain some real-life experience. I agree with the latter one because this increases a child's chances of integrating into adult life more smoothly.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, yearly-age workers spend their spare time doing something useful and, ultimately, will be rewarded with a salary. This acts as motivation to fulfil their wishes and teaches them that nothing is free; if you want to possess something, then make an effort. For example, a friend of mine is a farmer, and he has a son. The kid wanted a bicycle right away. The father suggested the son help him on a farm with daily duties in exchange for money, which could be spent on anything he wanted. In the end, the bicycle was bought, and the kid was happy. I think it was a great example of upbringing as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, kids who were employed would be much more prepared for adulthood compared to those who weren't. However, real work experience prepares adolescents for a smoother transition between childhood and upcoming adulthood. Also, the children would be able to value their spare time and would become closer to their parents.

Others think that if cultural activities are supported, the population and the culture may  benefit.

Art and culture are available in the world to those who have a high  quality of  life. Thus art and culture should be pay by private finance. To illustrate, if a rich person wants to get a wealthy artwork, he or she will pay a large amount of money to get it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that if the authority invests in cultural activities, it may bring benefits to the president and culture because they are hosted frequently. Moreover, they are very cheap or free for participants. Eventually, there will be more people joining these activities. Not only is it a great opportunity for the population to socialize in a wholesome way, but it also helps a nation  preserve its culture.

Jobs that used to require a lot of energy and time can now be done at the touch of a button.

For example, there are now thousands of free online courses available on YouTube that anyone can watch and learn from anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this essay argues that life has been greatly improved by technological advancements, particularly labor-saving phones and the learning opportunities provided by the internet.'",

What are the reasons for this movement to cities and what can be done to reduce it?' \n 'Text': 'As commonly seen, a number of folks are moving to cities becoming overcrowded instead of living in the countryside. In my opinion, many reasons suddenly turn up, in parallel, the government is striving hard to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, a large percentage of individuals are induced by plenty of developments resulting in the abundance of  ease, besides that, many are able to earn more income in urban since most organizations' headquarters are settled in the city due to the advantages such as the easier access of users. Not forgetting to mention that, each progress is expanded from the urban to rural either industrial or technological. For instance, in some countries, when it comes to transportation, the sky train which can be considered  a high-quality technology owing to numerous merits both for citizens and tourists is solely launched in the city meanwhile folks are using personal cars to commute in the countryside causing costs.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, most governments are trying to mitigate as soon as possible, many policies are offered in the council amongst ministers, and some reckon that advertising local brands can solve the troubles because the crowds can reap the income from the interaction, on top of that, some believe that technological developments should be operated not only in urban but also in rural. For example, firstly, the signal can permit the local students to approach the better sources of data and those are able to apply their knowledge in order to make the greatest benefit for the state, undeniably, it is very slow when compared to other realms and ought to be improved concretely.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, most folks want to live in the city as a result of several pros which have not happened in the countryside yet, hence, I opine that the distribution of progress seems to be very crucial to persuade individuals.'",

Both points of view make sense, but I agree with the latter one because art is not the only thing to be focused on.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, art undeniably should be funded and supported by the government. Consequently, more and more artists would be able to get a stage and the opportunity to express themselves. New exhibitions would be organized and jobs created, leading to the establishment of extra professional relationships. In addition to that, involvement from the younger generation would also increase. For instance, over the last decade, mostly big Ukrainian cities have taken part in international events dedicated to modern art. Nevertheless, I think that such actions should have been provided in smaller towns as well, helping outlying communities to be closer to this kind of activity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the investments that have been put into arts could have been spent on something else, like education. In this sector, plenty of areas could be found where additional government attention is required. For example, in small villages in Ukraine, not many school subjects remain due to curriculum reductions enforced by authority rules. Thus, locals have fewer programs, which results in a decrease in the average level of children's intelligence. However, I do believe that spendings have to be balanced out and used precisely, focusing on providing additional study facilities and opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the necessity of societal cultural development is hard to underestimate, although other directions of investments like education should not be forgotten as well.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Growing older is a natural part of our lives. While many people would view this with a pessimistic attitude, others believe that getting old would make life easier in the modern setting. In the following essay, I am going to discuss both views and state my opinion about the matter. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, becoming elderly would bring many shortcomings, most notably to people\u2019s well-being. This is due to the fact that, as individuals grow older, their immune system would degrade and thus, senior citizens would become weak and frail, as well as they are more likely to be vulnerable to diseases. Hence they require a lot of attention and need to be treated with care. For example, a mild shift in the weather conditions could result in severe illness among the elderly, and while they can recover after a short while, their health is seriously affected. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, senior citizens could have a happier life by receiving treatment from the young. To put this in a simpler way, the elderly could retire to their houses or a retirement home, both would surround them with the amenities and care needed by nurses and their family members, to ensure that the old could live as comfortably as possible. Taking individuals who would reside in a retirement home as an example, they will be assisted with daily routine by an assigned nurse and their meals, along with their health are strictly supervised so that they can stay away from sickness, while also maintaining a certain level of activeness. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while many people believe that ageing is certainly a negative thing because of the effects it has on their health, others assume that they could live more easily owing to the care they receive from their families and specialized facilities. In my opinion, I believe while there are certainly some limits to ageing, individuals could enjoy a much simpler life'",

Therefore, this method brings a special concern regarding the efficacy and reliability of the examinations to assess students' capabilities.\r\n\r\nI would like to start my argument by writing about the importance of the examinations. People who are in favour of this method believe that, after teaching each subject, pupils should be assessed to determine how effective was the course and how much students learn from the subject. They claim that paper-based tests are the best way because, all the students will be examined in the same and fair condition. Moreover, high-quality exams consist of different types of questions such as multiple-choice and essay tasks that give test-takers almost enough information about each individual student.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, people who oppose this kind of assessment argue that  students have different intellectual capacities and they should not be judged merely by taking paper exams. For instance, some of the students perform much better on group tasks, some have the ability to manage a team, and, some have better research skills. Thus, other types of evaluation techniques should also be considered. For example, group projects to determine teamwork ability or writing an essay to measure independent learning.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, based on what is mentioned above, in my opinion, the role of  formal pen and paper exams in assessing students' learning is undeniable. But, in addition to that, other forms of evaluations should be applied.'",

Do you think this is a positive or negative situation?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, in a number of countries, people are willing to buy a house as opposed to renting it. In my opinion, economic instability and governmental advertisements contribute to this situation. I am also convinced that homeowners are more likely to benefit from privacy and economic success. Therefore, the benefits of purchasing a house override its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, in some developing countries which face economic recession and high levels of inflation, citizens are compelled to buy a house. This may provide them with economic stability and prevent financial issues in the future. For example, in Iran, the rent and price of properties are escalating alarmingly on a regular basis. Consequently, if people do not take steps towards owning a house, they will never afford it. Moreover, the interest rate of bank loans is increasingly going up and taking a loan can be challenging to some extent. On the other hand, since housing is a primary source of revenue for governments, they encourage people to purchase a house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI further believe that owning a home is able to lift the burden from households\u2019 shoulders. This enables them to tackle other problems and experience economic prosperity. For instance, they are likely to make ends meet and save money for their children\u2019s education. Additionally, homeowners are able to take full advantage of privacy and calm. This may result in boosting the quality of life and health levels.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the economic stability and the policy of governments convince people to buy a house instead of renting it.

Whilst acknowledging that there are a few solutions other than increasing tax, I think the former idea is more beneficial than the latter ones. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental contamination is essential in all countries, and the majority of pollution is a result of industrialization. Therefore, some experts advise that the high tax policy can solve the issues. Because they believe that funds collected through taxes would be spent for the rehabilitation of the ecology. This is the most effective way to manage environmental deterioration with full accessibility and control. For example, in some countries, the government agent selects the companies that perform and are responsible for assessing the contamination and cultivation of trees and plants. Such projects are then financed by business owners through taxation.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can't be neglected that there are other methods to handle this problem, such as making the companies' operations more eco-friendly and pushing them to improve their technologies. However, this approach may bring certain advantages to companies and countries in the long run, which might take much time, effort, and investment to fulfil all requirements, including technologies, policies, and regulations.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are better ways to deal with industrial pollution, such as involving new technologies and initiatives, imposing a higher financial charge on manufacturers would be the best and fastest approach to collecting and distributing the funds for solving ecological and economic problems to restore and protect nature.'",

I personally do not agree with this statement because the exploration of space helps us to understand the universe better and allows companies to create a business around it. \r\n\r\nIt is believed that spatial trips will allow humans to understand their world and help them to attend to the problems that they face. Moreover, the answers to the Earth\u2019s issues can be found outside its atmosphere so, it is better for us to learn about what is there. For instance, in 2023, a research team from Harvard University analyzed what individuals thought about the 600 spatial discoveries made that year. About 62% of them believed that space missions are necessary due to the fact that such advances will help human societies face their problems correctly.\r\n\r\nResearching might help national economies grow thanks to the discoveries made during trips to space. The results of these will present the outside world as an important place to exploit  and will increase the economic situation in countries in a positive way. For example, after the first moon landing by India in 2019, 500 companies were created with the simple idea that the extra-atmospherical world was becoming accessible to them and that they should make money off of it. That illustrates that these missions are good for the progress of the economic state of all societies on Earth. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I think that we should make more explorations in order to become the best race out there and allow economies to grow.'",

Nowadays, all over the world people share the same fashions, advertising, brands, eating habits and TV channels.

The matter is that people have the same trends and habits in daily life facets like fashion, diet and media. Some might perceive this march negatively due to the loss of the original identity of nations although I presume that  overall, the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages. \r\n\r\nIndisputably, negative consequences naturally appear as more countries share a homogeneous culture and, greater a loss of uniqueness. Take the example of South Korea, which had an essential impact on the United States of America due to  industrialization, and now presents a small amount of folk arts and customs. A similar trend is noticed in Kazakhstan, where the Western concept of individualism turns foreground than traditional values. In addition, it is also exacerbated by lingua franca languages. Society strives to acquire high-level English or Spanish but a mere few of them can boast fluency in their native language.  \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it might sound counterintuitive, the main merit is that the public does not have uphill struggles. Indeed, the fashion industry looks for ethnic style and collaborates it with modern trends. Also because of the popularity of  cinematography, residents detect distinctive features of small local autonomies. Hence, they get a deep insight into behaviours and seem to be tolerant. When it comes to nutrition, it helps deprived ones to get accustomed to a well-balanced diet, as new kinds of greens and fruits show up in regional stores. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the interconnectedness of countries in cultural aspects is inevitable.

Others say that there are more important environmental problems.' \n 'Text': 'While some individuals argue that the most crucial environmental concern today revolves around the endangerment of a wide variety of plants and animals, others believe that there are more pressing and significant environmental issues at hand. This essay will thoroughly analyze both perspectives before ultimately affirming my agreement with the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is comprehensible why certain individuals argue that the extinction of specific species of flora and fauna constitutes a pressing environmental issue. The primary justification for this belief is that it can result in the depletion of biodiversity, which is a factor in significant environmental phenomena such as climate change and ecological imbalance. For example, numerous species of animals and plants are currently at risk of extinction, including the saola, Asian elephant, and turtle. Deforestation is a primary factor contributing to the decrease in the number of plants. Given these factors, it is entirely justifiable to believe that the loss of numerous wild species is the primary cause of environmental issues.\r\n\r\nConversely, I align myself with those who argue that there are more significant environmental issues. Primarily, the environmental problems arise from a confluence of multiple factors. Concurrent with the process of modernization and industrialization, individuals have not only achieved remarkable success in their lives but have also had a detrimental impact on the environment. For instance, transportation vehicles emit carbon dioxide, which contributes to the carbon footprint. Additionally, the untreated wastewater discharged by numerous factories poses a threat to human health and aquatic life. All of those issues are pressing and should be addressed promptly to safeguard our living environment.\r\n\r\nUltimately, while there are valid arguments supporting the notion that the depletion of wild species is primarily responsible for environmental problems, I maintain that these issues stem from a multitude of factors.'",

The primary reason is that each individual's unique way of reasoning influences their own decisions. For example, after graduating from college, some individuals may wish to reside close to their families or pursue a well-compensated occupation in a metropolitan area; therefore, they would intend to work in the region where they ultimately settle down.

From my perspective, I am inclined to stand neutrally with both aspects since they both considerably influence the future of the world.\r\n\r\nInitially,one of the main arguments in favour of environmental conservation is that it needs the world as a whole to work together to protect the Earth. As the Earth has become a village, the environment requires every human to have consciousness to conserve it.Therefore, international cooperation plays an indispensable role in communicating with different countries. For example, the International Emission Agreement set up a rule for the world to follow and has significantly limited  charcoal emissions. Thus,environmental protection indeed is a crucial issue of international cooperation.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, international cooperation can contribute to a significant effect on business as it is not restricted to a certain area. Take K-pop for instance, the charm of Korean idols has spread around the world.When those super idols host their tour concerts around the world, the business benefits are not only brought to the Korean pop industry but also the local tourism  where the concert is hosted. Hence, the development of world business is an essential proportion of international cooperation which will bring vibrancy to world economics.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, despite the fact that environmental conservation demands international collaboration, the importance of business potential cannot be ignored. Thus, countries should optimally cooperate so as to generate long-term merits for the world and create a sustainable living environment.'",

For instance, the Indian Education Department  conducted a survey with grades 5-12 and found that 6 out of 10 students  prefer to study in the library and got more than 85% by self-review just by using library material.  \r\n\r\nSecondly,it has multiple resources at a cheap price.To explicate ,in libraries, there are multiple editions and writers' books available for every stream and they can exercise for free in their.Moreover,if they want to take it home they can borrow it and just need to pay an amount of money as a deposit and when it is returned person can  that money back.Additionally,there are various machines presented for photocopying and printing at low prices.However, using online books can affect eyesight.

Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views' \n 'Text': 'A group of people believe that letting children choose what they want in something that they want like clothes, food and having fun would improve their selfishness. On the contrary,  others think that it is essential to have the right to make decisions in childhood because of its effects. In my opinion, a child needs  freedom in the way of living and sharing its tastes like another human being in everyday matters.\r\n\r\nChildren who can make a decision about their needs are more confident. Although parents have to lead and guide them to make a reasonable choice, they should teach youth the importance of having confidence and telling their own ideas instead of being quiet and obedient. If we do not give this opportunity to a child to say her/his opinion, it would make him/her a potential victim of bullying in the near future. For instance, pupils who are more free to say their thoughts about what they want experience less bullying than those who are shy and raised by the method of obeying  parents in order to what they wear or eat. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for this mindset is achieving a more democratic and equal society by teaching children to have their own choices in everyday matters. The young generation are the next citizens who can defend their rights in future if they see how they can do it from the early beginning. When they are allowed to be treated as a person respectfully in their preferences and what they want, it can not only improve their sense of identity but also eradicate any possibility of being a deactivated individual. We are witnessing the impact of these little activities in recent changes in political aspects and societies which have been done by recent generations for example [in Iran]. Through this, the world may be obviously healthier and a better place for humankind to live freely with less oppression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having the Right of choice in childhood about what they want as a hobby, clothes or food is a vital part of nurturing. This is a real protection to defend themselves from bullying in school and also as a civilized person against any dictatorial behaviour or policy'",

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.' \n 'Text': 'In many nations, governments put more focus on improving their economies than other sectors. Although residents\u2019 earnings will increase, I personally believe that the prime drawback outweighs the main benefit as this will cause environmental pollution.\r\n\r\nOne major benefit of prioritizing economic development is that it will solve the unemployment issues and significantly increase the number of employed citizens. That is to say, countries, where their economies are growing, require substantial workforces to produce sufficient supplies of goods in order to meet markets\u2019 demand. As a result, more and more citizens are in employment. Moreover, this will also offer citizens a better quality of life. This is because when economies are growing, governments will gain more taxes from trading and can spend them on welfare, substantially contributing to facility constructions such as hospitals, bridges, and educational infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, focusing only on economic development results in serious environmental damage. This is totally because manufacturing processes generate CO2 and other detrimental emissions, sewage, and industrial waste which are released into the environment and cause air, water, and soil pollution. Furthermore, industrial pollution will negatively affect people\u2019s health by causing respiratory diseases as well as some types of cancer. Take an example, a recent study concludes that most of the CO2 emissions come from industrial plants, leading to lots of photochemical fog which could be sometimes seen in cities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while prioritizing economic development will result in an increase in employment and a better quality of citizens\u2019 lives, the serious downsides that come with this are environmental pollution and residents\u2019 health.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Crime is a rife and serious dilemma. Fast-paced advancements are now one of the factors which take the blame for a violation, as many people claim that more and more brutal scenarios in media occur. Although it might sound obvious at first, I vehemently disagree with the statement. Criminal actions are primarily caused by economic and social backgrounds.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is explicable why the majority is used to view video games and films as culprits. Violence treatment and rewarding outcomes of a bad affair might build a wrong concept of the justice system. Especially, youth are easily influenced by these images on television, for instance, a serial Money Heist grabbed the attention of an audience for a prolonged period. All around the world teenagers create idols by following those characters. Also, the game industry is mainly dominated by fighting games, such as Mortal Combat and Tekken, which might spur them to take up experimenting with those tactics  in the real world. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that rough behaviour is displayed in multimedia, consumers are not stimulated to rob or even commit a homicide. As it was mentioned in the previous paragraph, family environment and financial condition are crucial sources for offenders. Accumulated debts and lack of valid education negatively impact a community. In addition, as researchers present constant physical or sexual abuse in childhood could enhance the percentage of a kid to become an inmate in the future. Hence, it is hard for individuals to break this vicious cycle and avert the criminal world.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is undoubtful that technology takes an essential role in many fields of our lives. But I believe, that in order to tackle the issue of growth in illegal acts, the government would better focus on anti-poverty projects and provide deprived people with proper education rather than accusing the mass media.'",

For instance, in the afternoon, children ought to play outside which is able to boost either physical or mental strength with their friends instead of studying unnecessary lessons which can reduce the courage and mark the wound in mind.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, loads of the folks opine that communication is very crucial nowadays because individuals are living in different countries which own each language, furthermore, cultural differences are considered the troubles often happening whilst not only working but living thus the group of people believe that the issues can be eliminated by the school. For example, Japanese is spoken in Japan, and in parallel, Americans speak English, hence, in the case of business communication, the translator is a must.

While some people believe that mobile phones should be banned in public places such as libraries, shops and public transportation, I would argue that mobile phones are necessary for people's lives. I will explain my reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a mobile phone is a tool for helping people's daily lives. This is because telephones can be helpful to people in any situation such as searching for a navigator when they get lost, used for calls in emergencies and for entertainment. For example, when people travel to new places or other countries they can use the online maps on their phone to find out the way to get to the nearest grocery, a restaurant or a hotel. As a result, smartphones can benefit people by quick data when they need any information immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that a smartphone is a good assistant in emergency situations. This is based on the fact that people can use this gadget right away when an accident happens in public places such as buses, trains and motorways. For instance, the news in Japan reported that 80% of emergency calls in accidents on  public transportation result in people using smartphones to report can be quick and can be fast to solve problems. Consequently, a mobile phone is a faster way to report any emergency situation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can observe that mobile phones can not banned in public places because this gadget is beneficial for human lives. Overall, I firmly disagree with this statement.'",

What can be done about this problem?' \n 'Text': 'It is true that many people worldwide suffer from hunger although  developments have grown in agriculture. There are several reasons for this and government should take some steps to alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why people face acute food insecurity is climate change. Climate variety and extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and storms can severely impact agricultural productivity. Small-scale farmers, who often lack the resources to adapt, are particularly vulnerable. For example, Zimbabwe is suffering a prolonged drought crisis which contributes to famine. Another reason is conflict. Regions affected by conflict or political instability often face challenges in food production. To be specific, wars and conflicts disrupt agricultural activities, displace populations and hinder humanitarian aid. For instance, millions of people in Gaza are on the brink of famine as they struggle to access food since the **Israel\u2013Hamas war**.\r\n\r\nAddressing hunger requires a comprehensive approach. Firstly, governments should promote sustainable agricultural practices that enhance resilience to climate change, conserve natural resources, and improve productivity. These measures can help ensure food security in the long term. For example, governments can introduce new laws to regulate the usage of fertilizer, which will reduce soil quality and fertility and thus impact  food productivity if used excessively. In addition, enhancing international cooperation and coordination among governments, NGOs, and international organizations is crucial for addressing food security and ensuring equitable access to food resources.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons why many people go hungry include climate change and conflict and governments should pay more attention to sustainable development and international coordination to address food insecurity.'",

While some people tend to suggest it, others believe that it has more drawbacks rather than benefits. It is my belief that purchasing things from the Internet has advantages that surpass its disadvantages for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, online shopping could save more time and energy rather than buying straight from the store. For example, customers need to spare their time to take a trip to the store, not to mention the money they spend on gas or public transportation tickets. Meanwhile, online shopping does not need customer presence, they only need to log into shopping platforms and  choose everything they would like to buy without having any interaction with the staff. In this case, online shopping is more convenient for busy people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, online shopping lacks in customers' experience to feel the materials or to at least do a trial of the stuff they want to buy. Although  reviews from former customers are provided on the platform, it does not mean  everybody will accept them since the reviews are written based on the opinion of the reviewer only. So online shopping would likely cause more disappointment after the stuff is received by the customer.\r\n\r\nAfter taking everything into consideration, I would say online shopping has more benefits for the sake of time. Moreover, the occurrence of bad stuff I mentioned above could be avoided by taking more time to read the review of the products.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In the modern era, the debate on whether government expenditure should prioritize the acceleration of public transport systems or channel funds into other significant areas remains contentious. Advocates of enhanced public transportation argue for its efficiency and environmental benefits, while opponents urge a focus on alternative priorities such as healthcare and education. This essay explores both perspectives, ultimately endorsing the balanced allocation of resources.\r\n\r\nProponents of investing in faster public transport systems emphasize the multifaceted advantages it brings. Primarily, it significantly reduces commute times, enabling individuals to dedicate more time to personal and professional pursuits, thereby enhancing productivity and quality of life. Moreover, rapid transit options such as high-speed trains and electric buses offer a greener alternative to private vehicles, mitigating carbon emissions and combatting urban air pollution. For instance, the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan has not only revolutionized travel within the country but has also set a global benchmark for efficient and sustainable public transportation.\r\n\r\nConversely, critics argue that government funds should address more pressing societal needs. The augmentation of healthcare services, educational facilities, and affordable housing, they contend, would have a more immediate and profound impact on the populace's well-being. An investment in these sectors is seen as foundational, ensuring a healthier, more educated society capable of contributing effectively to economic growth and social stability. The case of Scandinavian countries, where extensive investment in social services has resulted in high levels of societal well-being, underscores this argument.\r\n\r\nIn summary, investing in faster public transport has clear merits, yet it's imperative to balance this with enhancements in social services. A holistic strategy that values both infrastructure and societal health is key to a progressive society. Effective resource allocation can ensure transport improvements complement, rather than overshadow, essential social needs.'",

In other countries is expected that they move to other cities for course college. I believe that, overall, the benefits of studying in another town surpass the drawbacks. There are some advantages and disadvantages that this essay will discuss.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of studying far from home is the possibility to improve some personal skills, once the pupils have to resolve all the problems that can appear. For example, issues such as housing, bills, transportation, and bureaucracy have to be faced by themselves. As a consequence, the students become adults more prepared to work in the future. Additionally, living far from their parents' homes, adolescents can dedicate more time to academic subjects and they can experience life at university fully. In my personal experience, I attended college in another city far from my hometown. This situation encouraged me to manage  several problems by myself, and after graduation, I felt more confident to apply for jobs and attend interviews.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some negative aspects. One of the main cons is the cost of living higher than living at home. It is known that costs with housing and food are the major expenses. Furthermore, another disadvantage is that some people are not prepared to deal with loneliness. These people can feel homesick, or develop depression or some psychological disease.\r\n\r\nAll in all, to conclude, I think that the positive points surpass the negative aspects. The time during further education is a time for growth and personal development. So, living in another town is an excellent opportunity to increase a lot of abilities. As a result, after getting a diploma, students get more life experience and independence to address adult responsibilities.'",

This means they can enjoy themselves and spend quality time with loved ones.Women in particular reap the rewards as, in former times, they tended to be responsible for most of the laborious housework.They now have the opportunity either to work and become economically independent or to socialize, instead of scrubbing floors or chopping vegetables.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the popularity of these products has unwanted environmental consequences. Machines including vacuum cleaners and washing machines are made using nonrenewable and relatively scarce resources. When used, they are powered by large quantities of electricity, which is often obtained by burning fossil fuels. This obviously causes an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.Furthermore, as these items are deliberately designed only to last for a limited period, they soon have to be replaced and are thrown into landfill sites, which puts additional pressure on the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although we should not ignore the positive social and economic impact of the increasing use of modern appliances in the home, this trend is contributing to the depletion of natural resources and pollution.'",

There is a debatable argument between a group of people that using electronic gadgets specifically mobiles should not be allowed in learning institutions. I disagree with the idea as using mobile can be beneficial for teenagers in many ways. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss both views.\r\n\r\n     To start with, parents provide cell phones to their children for security reasons. If a youngster is stuck in an emergency they are able to call the police or their family. For example, my cousin who is in her last year, finished her classes and was waiting for the bus at the station. However, due to weather conditions, no transport services were working. Instantly, she called her mother and she was able to reach home safely. Not only this, mobile phones provide numerous benefits in education.

In my opinion, a wide variety of strict rules and the limitation of income within an organization or a company discourage people from being an employee. I am also convinced that going bankrupt and paying taxes can be the drawbacks of freelancing.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that a fixed salary may cause serious problems for employees. They are restricted by a certain amount of money which is paid on a regular basis. Many employees find it difficult to make ends meet and cover their expenses. For example, in Iran, the price of housing, food and clothes are escalating alarmingly day to day. Consequently, if you are an employee who earns a fixed salary, you will be never able to manage your expenses. Furthermore, employees have to conform to special rules that are enforced by their organizations or companies. For instance, certain working hours and dress codes are of paramount importance in such offices.\r\n\r\nI further believe that freelancing has its own difficulties. First, in some countries, economic recession may lead to the bankruptcy of businesses. They fail to make sufficient profits, and in turn, should change their work. Therefore, freelancers would face job insecurity and financial issues. Additionally, since you have your own business, you are compelled to pay taxes to the government. In some cases, self-employed people should pay around 50% of their revenue for taxes.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, strict rules in workplaces and receiving a fixed salary are the reasons for choosing self-employed jobs.

Some people believe that protecting historic buildings is more valuable than preserving the newest ones. It seems to me that rebuilding ancient relics is a worthwhile act and I will explain why in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the renewal of old standing is a relevant solution to restore the chronicles and identity of the nations. It means that people could comprehend their ancestor achievements in this way and pride their identity extremely. For example, Persepolis located in Shiraz displays the power and glory of the Achaemenid empire capital, and Kurosh the first king of the Achaemenid dynasty established to rule is a well-known place in the world that Iranian people are proud of. A second factor is that historical structure could be a symbol of civilization and culture of the society that it can attach ancient generations to new ones. Therefore, memorable edifices could show life conditions in the past. For instance, the air pocket of structures in Yazd shows that people used to cool the air inside the houses by this method they adapt themselves to hot and dry weather. This leads us to the final and perhaps most significant element that protecting old buildings can have an intensive impact on countries' income by attracting tourists This means that if tourists visit these places, an economic boom will happen. For instance, Egypt can earn lots of money from its pyramids. \r\n\r\nIndeed, some claim that renovating historical constructions costs a lot and is not affordable. Despite this, it seems that the preservation of aged buildings is a valuable investment for the countries.\r\n\r\n  In conclusion, it seems maintaining ancient structures can help economic growth, by recognizing chronicles, and cultural symbols. Although protest pretense restoration has a sheer cost correct management of reconstruction costs will be lower.'",

The latest has been propelled by advancements in technology, which have ushered in a new era of pedagogical methods. From my perspective, the development of transition represents a significant departure from traditional learning paradigms, presenting a couple of positive implications which enable easy access to virtual classes and offer an affordable Tuition Fee for international students. In terms of the adverse sides, a noteworthy amount of time spent on the screen leads to some health concerns and reduces the interpersonal communication level.\r\n\r\nThe advent of digital technology has democratized access to knowledge, offering international scholars unprecedented opportunities to enrol in online courses at their preferred institutions, guided by esteemed academics. Furthermore, this innovative approach has significantly lowered the financial barriers to entry, making high-quality learning more attainable for a broader demographic, particularly during times of global disruption such as the recent lockdowns.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite these advantages, challenges persist. The reliance on digital platforms for learning poses inherent risks, including prolonged screen exposure leading to health concerns resembling, sedentary lifestyle-related issues causing being corpulent and having poor eyesight. Moreover, disparities in internet connectivity exacerbate inequalities, hindering access to knowledge for marginalized communities. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, it can be seen that the improvement of electronic machines assists society with receiving their honourable degrees from foreign education centres even if they are not able to take part in the lectures in person. On the other hand, these communicative technologies are capable of being harmful, given that, an increasing stage of addiction to computers ends up with physical disorders.'",

Discuss the both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary times, one school of thought holds that the first priority of global collaboration is the environment, whereas others assert that the development of international business is more necessary. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favour of the former notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why global partnerships could greatly affect the thriving of the worldwide economy. First and foremost, it could utilise human resources. For example, advanced countries can provide modern machines, while developing countries supply an abundant labour workforce, which could improve the production and efficiency of manufacturing. Furthermore, taking part in international networking could enhance global trade. To be more specific, the World Trade Organisation has modified tax barriers and simplified the processes of import and export, which makes the transport and the price of goods quicker and cheaper.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons why I am convinced that the most important purpose of international cooperation is environmental protection. One rationale is that it could combat climate change more efficiently. In fact, by implementing general laws and strict regulations to control the amount of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions released into the air, thereby reducing the negative effects of climate change on a large scale. Another justification is that the worldwide partnership could maintain living conditions in the long term. This is because it could encourage developed nations to share their green technologies with others, which could not only create a stable life but also exploit natural resources reasonably and carefully for the years to come.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is irrefutable that  global collaboration brings numerous merits to the economy of the world, I would contend that the environment has gained more profound benefits.'",

This trend will offer a chance to attend one of the top campuses in their countries. For instance, many students in Indonesia who live in the countryside have a high motivation to apply the universities in the capital city or Java island, such as the University of Indonesia or Padjajaran University. They perceive universities in those places will have more chances for job prospects and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they will be more independent and learn to take care of their selves if they live without family.

Compulsory military service is beneficial and necessary. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'Around the globe, young people are unemployed as well as untrained for anything in life. Additionally, the army is in need of individuals, it is then believed that the youth should have compulsory military service. I firmly do not support this view since the standards of this institution do not always correspond with those of younger generations and the event would probably traumatize them. \r\n\r\nThe army has a specific set of values such as respect, nationalism and also the idea of following orders without questioning them. Furthermore, these sentiments do not always correspond with those of a young human. As a consequence, the juvenile person will not appreciate the fact of being in the army. For instance, there were important riots in Morroco in 2023 due to the installation of a mandatory service, which had standards that did not align with the Morrocan youth. This created terrible protests, but we can conclude that the military is not meant for everyone if it does not correspond with the way youngsters think. \r\n\r\nIt is also thought that the experience of military training can traumatize any person. Moreover, the values of this particular sector are also meant to be able to abuse  any subordinate causing the possibility to abuse  them. Compulsory training will only traumatize the individual without allowing them to develop any skill. For example, the scandal on the US junior navy, published by the New York Times in 2012, showed that almost 70% of them were abused in the training camps. In this percentage, 30% of the ones that answered expressed that the abusive events in question would scar them for life and, in 40% of the cases, they feel that they will not be able to move on from these traumatic experiences. This makes them unable to find a proper job in the future. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I wholeheartedly believe that  mandatory military service would not be good because the sentiments are not always shared by the youth as well as the training has a traumatizing effect on most of the forced subordinates.'",

This tendency leads to many beneficial ways for humans' entertainment and work. Therefore, this leads to more advantages that outweigh the disadvantages. This essay will expound on my views about the statement's pros rather than the cons and conclude the topic.\r\n\r\nTo commence, the majority of advantages of people using phones and the internet are more convenient for communicating with different countries' users whenever they need it. On top of that, online dating is more trendy nowadays owing to the contribution of extending your social circle. When some online daters utilise gadgets and the wifi connecting dating apps, they can socialise with their partners without face-to-face embarrassing situations. Another advantage is to have better chemistry interaction when people meet their peers online. Thus, mobile phones and the internet are crucial parts of their life socially.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even though there are many benefits to using gadgets for socialising, this also causes some drawbacks in humans using gadgets to communicate. One of the major disadvantages is relying on devices to chat with each one, limiting spending face-to-face meetings for family members. For instance, in my city, dozens of younger generations ignore their grandparents while they just chat with friends online. As a result, older generations and younger generations have a big gap between their bonding and isolation. Hence, this is more likely to pull out their relationships when adolescents focus on their phones with online chatting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the statement above, I believe that the advantages of using mobile and the internet outweigh the disadvantages as more user-friendly. Otherwise, if some adolescents can separate their time and be patient with their older ones, I suppose the disadvantage would disappear.'",

Others believe that the attitude of the student is what determines the success. From my point of view, the presence of the right tutor is significant to show the correct path to a learner.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of examples for this statement. Firstly, having a good mentor in life is vital as they can point the pupil in the true direction. Good teachers will help to rectify mistakes a learner commits and also provide advice to prevent future mistakes. For instance, an English professor in a university will not only correct the wrong grammar  but also identify the wrong usage of the language students may utilize in the future. They can give the proper practice sessions to the scholar.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, student attitude is equally imperative in achieving educational success, as without his will   , there is nothing a tutor can do to make him understand the concepts. If a learner has a positive outlook towards education, only then he can achieve a plethora of achievements. After all, If children are willing to study, they can do self-study.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is crucial to have both the correct attitudes as it keeps students motivated towards studies as well as a good teacher as children can  help one in bringing back a learn to the accurate path. Furthermore, I find it more consequential to have a proper guide in student life as it is really sophisticated to correct oneself on one own and identify self-mistakes.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion' \n 'Text': 'The debate over whether individual study or learning with the assistance of a skilled tutor is more effective has been longstanding. It is my contention that some individuals cannot study alone without  external interference due to certain factors, however, people who are skilled and motivated enough to conduct their studies should remain committed to their studies. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, proponents of self-study argue that it offers unparalleled flexibility and fuel of motivation to keep them going for long periods. Solo learners have the advantage of establishing a tailored study schedule and plan which is devoid of group or tutor-based limitations, giving them full freedom to drive their own studies as they desire. This autonomy in learning is believed to foster a deeper connection to the subject matter, encouraging critical thinking and self-reliance. Furthermore, presently, advancements accomplished in the field of technology enable  self-learners to benefit from the mass resources available on the internet through AI bots such as Chat GPT. Consequently, by utilizing these tools, individuals will be able to increase the pace of their learning and gain  broader access to  distinctive data resources. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, advocates for learning under the guidance of skilled repetitors highlight the importance of a structured way of studying which can significantly enhance  learning. It goes without saying that teachers not only provide expert insights into complex subjects but also offer immediate feedback on the questions raised by students, thus, increasing  proactive learning. On top of that teachers play a crucial role in disciplining students who are unable to keep themselves committed to their studies. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both self-study and learning with the assistance of a teacher have their unique advantages. A blended approach that leverages the strengths of both strategies might be the most effective way to learn new things, catering to a wider range of learning preferences and objectives.'",

The omnipresence of computers and state-of-the-art digital tools has made them as familiar as household appliances. It is agreed that these technological advancements carry advantages and issues that merit a nuanced discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a troubling aspect is cast by the shadow of digital progress, manifested in the form of technologically facilitated crimes. The reach and sophistication of computers and digital technology have lowered the barriers to malicious activities. For instance, access to powerful tools like generative AI has been democratised by entities such as OpenAI. While designed for constructive purposes, they have been misappropriated, with DeepFake videos being created, inadvertently escalating sexual exploitation crimes. This exemplifies how the pathway for criminal endeavours can be inadvertently eased by technological strides, consequently fomenting societal challenges.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the evolution of computers and digital technologies has undeniably streamlined our lives, transforming mundane tasks into seamless interactions. The lineage of computers, beginning with ENIAC, has morphed our work and lifestyle into a tapestry of efficiency and convenience. For example, a wallet-free existence has been made feasible in South Korea by converging functionalities such as transit, identification, credit transactions, and e-commerce within a single device, illustrating the enriching impact of digital advancements on daily life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a world stripped of robots, the internet, smartphones, and other digital technologies we have grown accustomed to is nearly impossible to envision.

First of all, all species have a right to be free and enjoy their life without human intervention or other kinds of human factors, so restricting them with limited living areas and halting their enjoyment of life can be considered as a kind of wicked manner. To cite an example, today it is an observable fact that many animals are kept in captivity, which directly affects their both mental and physical health adversely. Secondly, pets at home can not do enough physical exercises, leading them to be  poorly immune and develop some undesirable illnesses, which can end their life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I, like many others tend to believe that people usually keep pets at home due to several reasons that can not be overlooked. To begin, people, especially the elderly and the ones who live alone at home, keep pets in order to make their lives more colourful and enjoyable. For instance, pets at home can ,sometimes, help them to get rid of stress by playing with them and immersing those people in activities which strengthen their bond with life.

This phenomenon can be attributed to the positive outcome of these innovations, therefore positively affecting humankind. \r\n\r\nThe proliferation of industrial robots in manufacturing sites plays an essential role in enhancing efficiency and productivity. Unlike the human workforce, which can contract illnesses, life troubles, or boredom that adversely impact their performance at such repetitive tasks, these robots can work tirelessly without fatigue or breaks, resulting in higher output levels. Besides that, companies nowadays tend to prioritize minimizing operational costs; therefore, AI can be a sound option. This is because AI can take responsibility for a heavy workload that requires an overwhelming number of employees to solve with pinpoint accuracy. A prime example is Google, this company saves its financial resources that used to be paid for its personnel, thanks to AI. \r\n\r\nI believe that the persistence of this tendency can be beneficial to human beings.

In more detail, the emergence of this tool can terminate human intervention in such jobs that individuals traditionally do, potentially resulting in a soaring rate of unemployment. However, this replacement can force these unemployed workers to improve themselves in terms of skill and knowledge to apply for jobs that demand problem-solving skills and creativity.

Additionally, the quacks provide a remedy which is not scientifically proven. Some people had been using various medications by a hakim to control blood pressure. He later developed blood cancer which was attributed to the gold content in those chemicals. The mechanism of action of many over-the-counter items is not known so, if there is an overdose of any of the content, there is no antidote available to nullify its effects. As a result, a person having a heart attack or trauma rushes to the hospital's emergency for relief. As there are no proper wards for sick people in homoeopathic care, those requiring indoor management have to come to a doctor's clinic for admission.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the demerits of alternative medicines are more than their benefits. Governments should pay attention to the rising cost of medical treatment and make health reforms for the timely management of ill people in the best possible ways.'",

However, some may opine that this is risky. Others state that this is beneficial for us. I think this is a controversial topic, and I believe that it has more merits than demerits.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the reason why companies need our data is that they can use data analysis on it, and they can find more chances to improve their business. Machine learning models require enormous information to do the processing. It may predict the possible future and is good for making business strategies. For example, my previous company Fubon Group which is specialized in using data science to do anti-money laundering prevention. They stopped those happening successfully. Big data can be used in many fields such as marketing, accounting, finance, and so on. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some companies are not illegal, and they use your data for fraud. This is terrible! Those criminals earned billions of dollars by using these. For instance, some gangsters cooperate with the staff who are working in technology cooperation, because this is an easy way to get others' personal details. Furthermore, they use those citizens' phone numbers to make calls and tell them have to transfer their money to designated accounts. The cases of that have increased recently. The law enforcement departments have found so many types of fraud.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, data analysis is very popular, and people are using it in many things. It is a way to make our lives better.

This is the reason why many individuals think that a substantial income is much more crucial than the satisfaction of a job. I personally disagree with this viewpoint for many reasons, described in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the major reason that some people believe that a high salary is more significant than job satisfaction is that it is true to say that money does not always bring you happiness, but it is essential for survival and having a good quality of life. To illustrate, folks who come from a low-income family opt for a high-paying job instead of the job they love because they must support their families. Furthermore, the amount of money obtained from the job they like cannot afford to buy things they want. In other words, some people have a lot of expenses such as the rent for accommodation, telephone bills, electricity bills, clothes, as well as accessories. As a result, they decided to choose a hire-salary job rather than their preferred jobs but have a lower income.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one of the obvious reasons that I disagree with the idea is that doing unfulfilled work for a long time can have a negative effect on mental health. For example, I know many people who are suffering from burnout and always look forward to holidays and days off because they are dissatisfied with their working life. On top of that, doing what you love can be extremely beneficial to your career progression. That is to say, when you are passionate about your work, you will be motivated to contribute significantly. Therefore, you will receive a higher income due to your achievements.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, although there are numerous reasons why people say that a significant salary is more essential than job satisfaction, I strongly disagree with this notion for many reasons.'",

This phenomenon has its own benefits such as learning and exploring the workplace before your professional career starts and drawbacks like losing a world of opportunities in academic life. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will elucidate both aspects of this tendency and provide a reasonable conclusion.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, one of the predominant upsides of choosing vocational training is preparation for future life. To exemplify, when a young starts an apprenticeship in an outstanding company, it may pave the way for self-discovery and innovation at a young age. Furthermore, it is undeniable that they confront some rigours of various work conditions and learn to overcome these obstacles and work under  high levels of pressure. Therefore, on-the-job training offers numerous boons for the young, expanding their horizons and fostering a greater understanding of the world's complexity.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the paradigm, there is no doubt that its demerits cannot be underestimated. University life provides students with  like-minded peers and faculty with whom they can easily interact  and impart knowledge. Thus, they can pursue their academic interests while honing their professional skills through a wide range of educational resources and lectures by professors in tertiary education. If they refuse to participate in classes, they lose a chance to develop their personal and professional growth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed both sides of this issue, the advantages of training in a genuine workplace surpass its disadvantages in the wake of the above-mentioned reasons. It is important to emphasize that understanding the predominance of educational influence in our lives is essential, while a plethora of potential consequences of experiencing a real work environment cannot be ignored.'",

Do the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Various controversies have emerged as to whether studying overseas is necessary for college students. Some people claim that it is a waste of money. From my perspective, however, the merits of overseas studies far outweigh its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOne primary benefit for students is the opportunity to experience various cultures. This can force them to adapt to totally different lifestyles and broaden their horizons. When people are in a new place, they usually encounter obstacles that force them to find solutions to tackle these problems. For instance, international students are usually shocked by local customs that are significantly different from their country; nevertheless, such experience will equip an individual with the capability to handle many circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if someone wants to go to another country to acquire knowledge, they need to have more responsibility and money. The living cost overseas tends to be more expensive than their origin hometown. However, the salary can be much higher as well as the cost in these foreign areas. Take soft engineering as an example; To get an engineering degree, people need five times more money to study in the US, while the rewards of work can be ten times than those who work in Taiwan. Therefore, if people can find a well-paid job after graduating, it can easily cover the money they have spent.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I firmly believe that studying abroad is beneficial to students. Not only can they broaden their horizons, but they can also earn considerable incomes. Everyone should give it a try if they have this great opportunity.'",

Therefore, physical education and sport should be compulsory for all students in all schools. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that these days youth's immune system is declining so schools should mandatory subjects like physical education and sport.This essay agrees with this statement as it will make them physically active and allow them to explore new fields.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, playing sports will make their body more active physically and mentally . To explicate ,  in faculty students spend most of their time  sitting and studying and do not get a chance to do physical movement which makes them obese and leads to poor health. In addition to this,young minds now spend most of their time playing with phones and do not play any bodily games which is also an invitation to a lot of illnesses.For instance,in 2023 WHO(World Health Organisation)conducted a survey  of university students in America and found 6 out of 10 kids have movement disorder and these pupils are found with gaming tablets and playing online.Hence,  taking physical education as a required subject will help children to do some movement at the institution.\r\n\r\nSecondly,through teaching them athletics, they can enter  new areas of interest.To elaborate , if institutions start teaching  games in academies it will create interest  among children and they get a chance to take a look at different sectors.As,there are many individuals who are not good in academics through these  courses they will get a chance to go and create a bright future.For example, 'Sania Mirza' (Badminton sports player)  studied till only grade 12 .She was not great in academics but brilliant at sports .So she started playing at the age of 12 and made a career in this field and today she is an international player.Thus, these paths will give students new opportunities.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,I strongly believe that presenting play and physical education subjects will be beneficial for teenagers as it will make them physically strong and new pathways for their future.'",

This essay discusses both sides and explains why I agree with the first group.\r\n\r\nMany believe it is better to be in a social group that agrees on the same ideas all the time. The main reason for this is because it prevents arguing and conflicts. By agreeing with each other, people can have more peaceful and fruitful conversations. For instance, my friends and I usually enjoy chatting casually about light-hearted subjects, instead of arguing about ideal differences. Additionally, having friends who share the same beliefs provides a closer bond. This is due to them seeing others as part of themselves and, as a consequence, treasuring and taking better care of their relationship.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others feel it is better to have friends who share the same beliefs. This is because it might promote personal growth within the group. When friends expose different opinions, individuals have the opportunity to learn something new and change their ideals. For example, colleagues who do not share the same religion might discuss their beliefs' differences and similarities. Moreover, hearing different points of view makes individuals go out of their intellectual comfort zone. This is due to learning a wider variety of perspectives related to the subject, and therefore, expanding one's knowledge about it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe both sides of the argument have merits. However, overall, I think the advantages of having light-hearted chats and developing a stronger bond outweigh the disadvantages of sometimes being stuck on the same ideas and having a limited perspective on a subject. Furthermore, in my opinion, different ideas and opinions can be acquired by talking to family members and work colleagues.'",

In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will delve into the underlying reasons for this penchant and its profound impacts on individuals and societies as a whole and provide a reasonable conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne of the predominant causes of this interest was the complexity of the program and its demands for a greater understanding of the world around us. To exemplify, some people have a notion that it may seem fascinating to them to unravel some puzzles or mysteries within the movie. Furthermore, from a different standpoint, others can be fed by chaos and violence in certain episodes if they consider it as a source of joy and fulfilment. \r\n\r\nThe possible effects of this predisposition are manifold and alarming. Initially, when these kinds of movies are watched by adolescents, they can evoke a sense of horror, placing humans at a heightened risk of harm and even mortality. Conversely, there is no doubt that its upsides cannot be ignored due to the fact that TV programs and movies that contain some crime and legislative events can improve critical thinking and decision-making skills under a high level of pressure. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested all the aspects of the phenomenon, the acute \r\n\r\nconsequences of watching crime films extend beyond individuals to broader society.

Although there are undoubtedly many problems on Earth that need tackling, I firmly believe that diverting financial resources from space exploration would be a mistake. These projects have brought, and will continue to bring, great benefits to humanity.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding example of this is the remarkable improvements in our lives due to the developments of satellite technology, a direct result of space exploration. Over several generations, satellites orbiting the Earth have not only facilitated scientific advances in areas such as weather monitoring and navigation but have also transformed our daily lives. Thanks to the satellites, we have witnessed profound changes in the way we connect with each other, using the internet to bridge distances and accessing international news and TV broadcasts with unprecedented convenience. Satellite technology has interconnected the world, shaping the way we live today.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, cutting-edge technologies initially developed for space exploration have been successfully adapted and turned into everyday products for use on Earth. These spin-offs cover a wide range, from comfortable memory foam mattresses to tiny cameras in mobile phones, which were developed from efforts to make cameras smaller for use in spacecraft. These examples illustrate how innovations originally intended for space exploration continue to yield practical benefits to humankind.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there is no doubt that expenditure on space research is enormous.

This essay is going to discuss both of these perspectives.\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors that each country is measured to be a safe and secure one, is the rate of crime in that region. Therefore, numerous people consider it hazardous and claim that those criminals have to be hanged or sentenced to death or they will make streets unsafe for residents. For instance,violations that take place in  public make the atmosphere heavily unapproved for tourists and even for local people. Additionally, these unsafe conditions lower the credibility and reputation of any country in the world in the blink of an eye and act as a barrier to foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, wrongdoing and illegality are blamed by the majority of people throughout the world and doers should be punished and reformed. In this regard, many suppose that there are other options for criminals apart from death and placing these people in specific rehabilitation centres like the one for addicts  will result in better and some of them may be able to return to  society.

For instance, they see the world from the foreigner's perspective which differs from the local one. Also, they justify that the equipment and facilities to produce a movie are not the same in all areas and special countries such as the US are pioneers in this regard. Therefore, they disagree with watching only native movies.\r\n\r\nHowever, various films are new schools of thought and penetrate new ideologies which can be positive or negative. Local movies should be at the centre of attention by the governments so that they can develop them as time passes. The reason is to keep the culture and traditions alive and to illustrate it to the public and make revenue. In addition, states can introduce themselves to the world through their modern film industry.

It is asserted that young people spend a wide range of time on computers and TVs. The writer wholeheartedly agrees with this statement because they will neglect their studies and negatively affect their strength.\r\n\r\nIt is significant to be aware that education will not be seriously focused on owing to the fact that they use almost their time for playing games and watching programs on TV.

As a result, the more time they use, the worse academic accomplishments they get.\r\n\r\nAnother vital ingredient of the case for not using computerized appliances is that it will cause a growing number of adverse effects on mental well-being. It should be obvious that they just want to have private space with their appliances and do not need anyone to talk with.

I personally believe that this statement is a terrible development and will bring great sequences in the long run.\r\n\r\nFirstly, regarding the growth of technology, each person owns a smartphone that can have access to widespread information through them, however, not all the information provided is accurate and reliable, as some people are giving some information with no scientific base. As a result, many individuals can be fooled by them and tend to rely on some treatments and medicines to feel better not knowing the consequences of them, which can also be the reason for their future difficulties. For example, there are a variety of physical movements available on social media regarding workouts to prevent backache, but the bones in our back are crucial to our life, and with a sudden wrong movement, the ability to walk might be lost for the rest of our lifetime.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, using these supplements without professional help will eventually make the immune system weak day by day so that the white blood cells in our body will not be able to fight against viruses.

However, others opine that it is not a necessity. This essay will discuss both views as far as I am concerned I am in favour of the former notion.\r\n\r\nTo commence with,it is significant to study international languages. To explain ,  acquiring  knowledge of overseas languages  will not only broaden up horizon of knowledge but also open up new pathways for the future of pupils.In addition to this,attaining a particular vocabulary creates another option for them if they want to go to that  country where the style is spoken then they do not have to worry about communicating.  For instance,  these days a lot of human beings are moving to Canada and America for further studies and for that they have to take IELTS(International English Learning Test) in which there are speaking, writing, reading and listening tests and there are huge individuals who didn't study English in schools because schooling is in their native speech and they are paying a chunk of money to learn this accent but if school start giving education in English or provide extra classes for that it will help present youth in terms of communication and money too. Learning the basics of languages can be a beneficial factor for some masses.\r\n\r\nShifting toward the final view, why it should be not important because of the stress and extra work.

I believe it is highly unlikely that it will completely replace physical retail and lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities.\r\n\r\nOne reason why I consider this  unthinkable is the value of personal interaction and customer service in retail. Physical stores offer the opportunity for customers to ask questions and receive recommendations from sales staff, which is something that cannot be replicated through online shopping. For instance, clothing and other items that require fitting or trying on are often best purchased in person with guidance from trained professionals. This personal interaction is important to many consumers and is likely to keep them coming back to physical stores.\r\n\r\nAnother explanation for my negative view that the disappearance of retail outlets is unlikely is the issue of delivery delays and problems. While online shopping can be convenient, there is always the risk of delays or issues with the delivery of purchases. This can be frustrating for customers and may prevent them from choosing online shopping over physical retail. Additionally, certain products, such as fresh produce or flowers, are not well suited to being shipped and may be damaged in transit.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my stance that it is inconceivable that the rise of online shopping will lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities. This is because online shopping cannot completely replace the value of personal interaction and customer service, or the convenience of being able to purchase certain products in person without unexpected delays or damage from deliveries.

Additionally, this flow of tourists brings in a substantial amount of money that can help improve and maintain current infrastructure, as well as develop new ones in the destination country. Finally, from a social viewpoint, interactions between people from diverse backgrounds and cultures at tourist attractions can foster positive behaviours like respect, tolerance, and adaptability to different situations and individuals, contributing to efficient social development. Visiting foreign countries and experiencing different cultures can broaden the horizons of the travelling community.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are also drawbacks and negative effects to consider. Environmental issues such as increased pollution from exhaust fumes emitted by various means of transportation due to more travel, and the generation of waste by tourists during their visits, pose significant threats to the environment . It is essential to implement and  enforce relevant laws and restrictions to prevent irreversible damage to the planet\u2019s nature and wildlife.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the most effective approach to this trend is to maintain a fair attitude towards both its advantages and disadvantages simultaneously.'",

Additionally, 65% of them are used to them in everyday situations, making the offspring learn faster in every subject that uses these technologies. \r\n\r\nIpads as well as laptops should not be used in class due to the fact that they manipulate the students\u2019 minds, making them not useful for learning.

These can be mended by avoiding unhealthy food and adopting a nutritious eating routine.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view, there are various reasons contributing to the prevalence of imbalanced diets, such as demanding work schedules and limited incomes. Many people are deeply occupied with their professional commitments, leaving them with inadequate time for proper meals of hydration. Additionally, low-income individuals are constrained in their ability to afford wholesome food options, thereby affecting their dietary patterns. For instance, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has reported an increasing proneness to diabetes and heart-related conditions among its citizens.\r\n\r\nSome solutions that can be done to this problem are establishing a regular nutrition plan and reducing the consumption of fast food. Maintaining a consistent meal plan that includes a balanced selection of proteins and vegetables is essential. Moreover, the intake of instant noodles, pizza, burgers, and other junk foods should be diminished, as excessive consumption of processed food can elevate the risk of various illnesses.

Therefore, universities should replace traditional books with digital materials. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, the accessibility of information on the internet has led to the importance of books on the verge of diminishing. Many people believe that textbooks should be replaced with technological ones. This essay will argue that the benefits of the situation exceed the drawbacks due to its practicality and eco-friendly improvement.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the main advantage of using digital books for college students is its accessibility. People can access books on their mobile phones or computers, which lets them study autonomously with just a click. As a result, the students can cut their expenditures on buying textbooks, which brings opportunities to allot the money to other necessary expenses. In addition, since digital books are paperless, this situation is also beneficial for the environment, hence reducing logging activities. For instance, a 2019 BBC study showed that Indonesia's paper industries have dwindled by around 15% over the last three years. \r\n\r\nDespite the advantages, some people believe that e-books can cause eyestrain. The amount of time spent on screen exposes the retina to ultraviolet rays from the devices. Although radiation is likely to cause farsightedness, it can be prevented using anti-radiation glasses. Moreover, it is a challenging issue for underprivileged university students who cannot afford a particular gadget for e-learning, but in this matter, the institutions or government can resolve it with their financial aid.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while digital material has drawbacks, such as weakening eye vision, that can be avoided by utilizing special glasses, its benefits, including flexibility, convenience, and environmental friendliness, outweigh its disadvantages.'",

However, there are some people who would put effort into watching an art show's direct shows such as opera or live music events. In my opinion, I would prefer to attend the on-site performance despite looking at it on the screen for several reasons.\r\n\r\nLive-action theatricals or music concerts give exceptional experiences for some reason. We can enjoy the actors or singers presenting their artwork directly. There is no edited scene or tuned vocals while they performed it in real-time shows so we would see their talent. Then, watching the artist's performance on-site could be a good appreciation for their works because people usually pay more and put more effort into seeing their actions directly through live shows. Enjoying the shows with other fans with similar enthusiasm also gives another impression rather than watching it at home.\r\n\r\nWatching an event through an entertainment platform could be more efficient since we can access it whenever we like. Nevertheless, it has a drawback such as the movies or songs might be adjusted to eliminate certain mistakes that could occur during the production, so the viewers were not able to judge their actions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree that attending live action would give a better experience rather than watching it through your personal devices, even though there will be additional effort to enjoy it.

On the other hand, others hold the belief that they should have the freedom to choose their working environment. I personally agree with the latter opinion, and I think that each individual has to have a chance to choose their working place.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some individuals think that you have to remain in your own country in order to help your own society, as it may bring a sense of belonging and personal culture and identity. They may believe that leaving your hometown to help other societies is not an acceptable manner and it is crucial to be dedicated to your land. Another reason behind this statement is due to the poor economic situation which will lead youngsters to leave the country, as this will put nations in a terrible situation. Furthermore, they may insist on keeping professionals where they were born.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some others argue that each person has to be free to work wherever they want, in order to have a better career path in the future. Some countries are not able to provide the appropriate environment for professional careers to grow, and they would not get the opportunity to meet their needs properly, as a consequence, doctors have no chance other than leaving their town for their personal growth and the feathers provided by other developed countries.

Do you think it is a positive or negative development' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, people increasingly tend to purchase luxury brands in all sorts of goods that are produced. This trend is more likely to be a result of strong advertisements and the impacts of influencers on social media. In my own perspective, it can bring about more negative consequences than positive ones.\r\n\r\nInitially, the power of marketing and advertisements of well-known brands should be taken into consideration. They promote their astonishing and luxurious products that benefit from well-defined slogans and eye-catching billboards, which manipulate various minds and persuade them to place orders for any new release of their product lines as soon as possible. Additionally, social media accounts with millions of followers can facilitate the encouraging phase of different targeted consumers and lead to more engaging potential customers apart from existing ones. For example, when Rihanna, a famous celebrity, posts about a particular cosmetic brand on her social media pages like Instagram, the number of people who look for that brand just seconds following, can illustrate the strength of social accounts and the relevant marketing on those platforms.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this growing number of advocates, there are various implicit and explicit consequences that should be mentioned.

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Communication is a key aspect between people, especially so in a social setting. A handful of people hold the opinion that it is vital to be a person who listens well as compared to someone who speaks well. In this essay, I will delve into both sides of the coin before presenting the reason why I think that it is crucial to strike a balance and be the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nTo begin, a good listener is someone who takes in the information attentively while the other party is talking. They also give the speaker the opportunity to talk without any interruption. This not only allows the person presenting the information to speak with no pressure but also makes them feel heard. Adding on, a person who listens well always provides a response relative to what they have heard which goes to show they are indeed listening and not just nodding their heads in agreement, making them a great company to be with  A great example would be allowing a friend who has had a bad day to express his grievances without any judgement.\r\n\r\nNext, on the other side of the coin, there are the good talkers. They are able to converse fluently with any given topic with anyone who's willing to lend them a listening ear. These people are usually, if not, always, the catalyst of the social event and the people pleaser. A good talker is essential for breaking the ice at any event and is the one with the most connections. For instance, my close friend, Justin is someone who is very well connected due to the fact that he is always the one who initiates conversations. This has opened doors for him to go from job to job with ease due to his wide social circle.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree to a certain extent that being a great listening ear is vital but I felt that being a great speaker is also crucial in a social convention as well, due to the limitless possibility of expanding horizons.'",

As a result, people eat more food produced in other regions than local food. \r\n\r\nDo you think the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Human beings and all other creatures' hearts beat because they consume something that generates energy and power. People have access to different types of things to eat from other places. Therefore they significantly eat more products from other lands than domestic ones. This essay is going to reveal  how this action is not privileged but rather brings about abnormalities.\r\n\r\nThere are some people who are not willing to use  native foods and rather choose the non-native ones. For instance, the Turkish Kebab is being consumed by  many Iranian people and these groups believe it is more tasteful than local Kebab. In addition, a diverse range of  fruits being eaten in  most areas does not even belong to those countries. There are advantages regarding this issue on the one hand and some disadvantages on the other hand. When local people are not interested in their original food the producers will be disappointed in producing them due to lack of income and rate of selling and rather will make non-native food in the locality which is not introducing them well.\r\n\r\nBesides, some traditional foods which are being cooked in order to preserve the ancient traditions will be exacerbated and eliminated gradually just because there is no demand for them and one day they will see they have completely changed their tastes. What is beneficial is that miscellaneous foods are available everywhere and everyone including the tourists can choose their favourites. Moreover, it has to be approved that some foods are more delicious than others and will be accessible to the whole community. By way of illustration,  fast food is a Western food which is presented all over the world by different names such as KFC, McDonald and so on.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though there are some advantages to consuming  non-local foods, using the original ones by the local people will maintain culture and tradition as well as improve their qualities by changing  people's tastes over time.

Fast food such as fried chicken, hamburgers, french fries and so on are quite delicious and people all over the world are crazy about them. However, those foods are unhealthy for human beings, and it is not a good idea to order them fairly often. In my perspective, putting taxes on junk food is a good idea so that we can reduce our desire to eat them and governments can earn more money from this policy, killing two birds with one stone. Otherwise, more and more people are facing weight gain problems. People who are overweight usually have so many problems such as high blood pressure, heart attack, moving slowly, and the like.

I believe that medication producers should review pricing strategies in these countries to help these people. This essay will discuss some aspects of this situation and explain why I agree with this idea.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that drug companies aim for profits and it is totally acceptable in capitalist system. However, it is known that some enterprises practice abusive prices, once their products save lives. As a result, most people are supposed to pay any value. The problem is people who can not afford it, mainly in developing nations. In this situation, companies that produce essential remedies should reduce their price. This can be done by governments reducing taxes or giving some benefits to these companies. A good example happened in Brazil, in the '90s, when the Brazilian government broke patents for drugs to control AIDS. This measure allowed other companies to produce the same medication at lower prices. \r\n\r\nMoreover, drug companies should reduce profit rates in poor countries and use them for marketing strategies on social concerns. These companies invest billions of dollars in advertisements each year  but do not want to reduce their price. People's lives are much more important than profits. Using this marketing planning can help enterprises sell more in wealthy nations. In addition, the cost of production of medication is not so high. The problem is the cost of research and development (R\\u0026D) of new drugs. Once again, governments should help by investing more money in innovation in the health business to reduce the total cost in this industry.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I think that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices with the collaboration of governments by reducing taxes or giving benefits to businesses that invest in R\\u0026D. As some medications are essential for saving lives, they should be affordable for everyone.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of children of having a school uniform?' \n 'Text': 'At the present time, a plethora of schools have introduced special uniforms and put much effort into controlling their student's appearance. Nevertheless, others do not much care about their uniforms. In this following essay, I am going to describe and compare both sides and want to write benefits and drawbacks.\r\n\r\n   On the one hand, perhaps the biggest disadvantage of being very strict about uniforms is that some households do not have a reach budget to purchase them. This is because children change their clothes' size almost every year and  plenty of financial pressure is put on their families. For instance, some of them could easily use everyday clothes and their parents would not be obliged to buy new school uniforms each academic year. Another basic downside would be that by making everyone wear the same clothes, children would not be able to express their personality and creativity. For example, a number of adults want to follow the latest fashion trends, but with uniforms, they are not able to do that.\r\n\r\n   On the other hand, the main positive side of having a uniform is that all of the pupils in the academic institutions are dressed the same. In other words, humans who belong to rich families do not have the opportunity to show off expensive clothes and pieces of jewelry. In this way, students from disadvantaged situations would not feel inferior to others. Furthermore, students who wear  the same and special uniforms start acting more dutifully to their studies.\r\n\r\n   To sum up, my opinion is that wearing uniforms is an excellent way to control students' appearance. Moreover, I think that the government should create funds to help poor families with school clothing expenses.'",

This essay will shed light on both points of view and reveal my personal perspective.\r\n\r\nThose who agree with the opinion that brain drain does not have as harmful as known consequences on society present various grounds to support their disposition. Firstly, they think that brain drain is just important for individuals in order to advance their lives, meanwhile, these people are just a small part of the population, which can not have significant results.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would argue, unlike many others, that brain drain has adverse outcomes significantly for the home country, while beneficial and advantageous results for the host country that much. Initially,it can cause social and national imbalance in the home country. In a more precise explanation, if the majority of citizens of the country are attracted to the host country, it will alleviate the number of people in the home country as well as pave the way for overpopulation in the host country. Additionally, the lack of employees in the home country is also one of the possible sequel in future.

Some argue that kids raised in families with limited financial resources are better equipped to handle the challenges of adulthood compared to those from affluent backgrounds. However, others argue that ones who are brought up in wealthy households have a greater ability to orient themselves in their future.\r\n\r\nI personally think that I\u2019m more likely to be in the group that thinks that people from poverty-stricken backgrounds are one step ahead to live independently than the ones who were growing up with the silver spoon. First and foremost, children are used to handling housework, socialising, and working at part-time jobs at the same time, so they understand how money appears. As well, they know how essential your skills and studies are in view of the fact that their parents have no ability to provide their university education, so they should pay for it by themselves. Additionally, they frequently learn the value of hard work, resourcefulness, and resilience at an early age. These qualities make them appreciate others' labour.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, adolescents from affluent menage enjoy certain advantages that can enhance their preparedness for adult life, which I believe is beneficial for them. Terefore their monetary security provides them with opportunities for quality education and access to influential networks. These advantages can equip them with valuable skills, knowledge, and connections that may facilitate success in the professional world. Moreover, the absence of economic stress can contribute to better mental and emotional well-being, allowing them to focus on personal growth and development.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, for my part children from households with limited financial resources are better prepared to handle adult life problems compared to their affluent peers, but not in all circumstances, because not the only wealth of families matters.'",

What are some possible solutions?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays we use single-use products in our life a lot. I agree with this statement that it can lead to pollution of our environment. However, if we change single-use products that are not that harmful to our eco-system, into reusable products, the problem can be solved sensibly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe usage of disposable products has a bad effect on our ecology, exactly on environmental contamination  which is essential. People use these things in their daily lives, and after being used it is thrown on the ground or the sea. Consequently, this can be harmful to the sea inhabitants and our health either. For example, according to the International Scientistic Centre, there are 0.5 tons of plastic and other single-use products that were thrown away and they can stay without any form change for more than ten centuries.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, if we start to use eco-safe reusable bags or bottles, instead of single-use package deals, the problem can be solved. The advantage of reusable products is: that they can be used again and again without any necessity of being thrown away. What is more, it might be even operated by our future generation. For instance, in Sweden, up to 70% of disposable products in local supermarkets such as plastic bulk were replaced with reusable shoppers like paper bags or fabric bulk for groceries.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo sum up, single-use products are very common in our lives.

Do you think it is a positive or negative development' \n 'Text': 'There has been an increasing number of shoppers wanting to get their hands on branded goods like clothes, cars and other luxury goods. It can be argued that this trend can be either a positive or negative development. In this essay, I will address both sides of the coin by using famous footballers as an example before presenting my view.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, most famous footballers these days are endorsed by major brands to don their products. These athletes can either be seen exercising in branded clothing or driving downtown in their posh supercars. By simply doing so, they have captured the attention of their fans who will be influenced to purchase similar items as well. In terms of profiting from all the attention, the major brands are seeing it as a very positive development as they can see their sales figures rising sharply every time their sponsored star wear their apparel. For instance, it is reported that American company Nike, quadrupled their earnings for the year 2009 when Cristiano Ronaldo started to represent their brand.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as more and more football players are signed to represent other brands, this has also led to adolescent fans demanding extra allowance from their parents in order to dress like their idols. This development negatively altered the thinking of these fans as they misunderstood what being successful is like. For example, in the United Kingdom, it was found that 6 out of 10 teens stole from their parents' wallets so that they could splurge on luxury goods as a result of being heavily influenced by their idols. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I do agree that in terms of commercial revenues for these companies, it is a positive development and the possibilities are endless with regard to profiting from the footballing market. However, I also think that it is generally a negative and worrying development that young fans are too engrossed in the glitz and glamour of what they are wearing because their favourite player is wearing this and driving what.'",

This essay will discuss some of its effects such as loss of biodiversity and poor health of people. And some of the solutions to fight this is to increase carbon pricing among companies and to promote strict recycling.\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of global warming in the world is the loss of biodiversity. The gas emitted by factories and fueled cars can lead to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment which can harm and kill animals and plants. These deaths can lead to a disruption in the life cycle of all living things on Earth. In addition to that, this phenomenon can also lead to poor health of people. Global warming can lead to extreme weather to which humans are not accustomed  and as a result, people can experience health problems such as stroke. For instance, in the Philippines, it gets extremely hot , especially in summer, and this has caused an increase in hospital admissions.\r\n\r\nOne of the effective solutions to address this is by increasing  carbon pricing , especially for companies that are using large amounts of fossil fuel. In this way, corporations can be forced to shift to using alternative energy. Moreover, promoting strict recycling can help reduce the amount of garbage that needs to be burned. Thus, this can help clean the air and decrease the amount of carbon emissions. For example,  Germany has implemented recycling in schools and companies, and as a result `they are the cleanest country in the world. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the detrimental effects of global warming can be seen every day, and some of its effects are loss of biodiversity and poor health. However, this can be solved by increasing the carbon price in companies and promoting recycling.'",

To What extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.' \n 'Text': 'Various controversies have emerged as to whether students should study a second language in elementary school. Some people claim that this might jeopardize their mother tongue. From my perspective, however, the benefits of learning a foreign language far outweigh its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOne primary reason is that learning a new language can broaden pupils\u2019s horizons. Empirical studies have provided considerable evidence that juveniles who learning a second language or even a third language have more creativity than others. When people use different languages, their thinking has a variety of perspectives on the same thing. For instance, when it comes to drawing a chair, children who only learn Chinese usually treat it as an item without any gender. Nevertheless, pupils who learning Chinese and Spanish will think it has female gender. As can be seen, languages have a profound impact on children\u2019s creativity.\r\n\r\nOpponents often argue that foreign languages in detrimental to our mother tongue. They state that if pupils study a foreign language too early, they might forget their native language. Nevertheless, these languages from different countries will not supplant our first language; instead, there might be a combination between these languages and improve the expression of the local language. Take Japanese for example, the are a variety of borrowed words in this language since the original words can indicate those things overseas such as motorcycles and tomatos. By learning a second language, pupils have the opportunity to learn their mother tongue even faster, which is a win-win result.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I firmly believe that pupils should learn a second language as soon as they get into school.  Learning a foreign language can not only broaden their horizons, but it can also help them learn their own mother tongue even faster.'",

Not only does it bring along benefits for the aspect of studies, but it is also applied to increase the citizens\u2019 quality of life. In my personal viewpoint, I strongly agree with this assertion and this essay will acknowledge the validity of this statement and elaborates on my reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are lots of instances where science and technology do great harm to human life. Regarding the subject of the military, to usurp the natural resources of another country, people keep creating more weapons with the aim of war. In the past, things came to worst when it came to the ambition of making the most of an opportunity in a war as they used nuclear bombs. In peacetime, science is negative and exacerbates environmental problems, which will devastate all human civilization as plants release toxic chemicals and hazardous substances. more, because of all the convenience and comfort that technology has brought us, we've turned into a society of wimps who can't stand a little discomfort. In brief, if misused, science might bring about a number of tragic scenarios to the people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, science will support orientation for the urgent problem of the nation in every aspect. Let\u2019s take the field of medicine as a perfectly good illustration that is accompanied by the development of life-saving drugs as well as vaccines that have saved countless lives, advanced treatments, and surgical procedures. In 2020, many countries have found ways that control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of vaccines, leading to a downward trend in terms of the percentage of patients, significantly reducing mortality rates worldwide, and helping the world normalize activities. Similarly, scientific achievements in the production of renewable energy have proved its potential to mitigate climate change. A further point to discuss when it comes to the aspect of education is that science stems from a hypothesis based on reality, which will create new teaching methods that will be applied in our classrooms soon. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I realized that science has many advantages and disadvantages. However, I still accept the opinion that studies are fundamental as the main objectives of science are associated with ameliorating people\u2019s lives and addressing the issues of the globe in the future. Hence, people need to nourish positive attitudes towards as well as the continuous pursuit of science.'",

Others believe that children who are taught to cooperate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'We are living in an extremely competitive world. This society is continuously pushing us, making us feel that we must be the best in everything we do, and that we must have a rivalry with our colleagues to be better or to get more recognition than them. However, in the long run, I don\u2019t think this theory has been proven true. In this essay, I would like to argue why I believe that the education approach should be reconsidered in our schools, so kids stop competing between themselves and are shown the importance of cooperation to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nIt has been widely instilled in our educational system that you have to be always better and if possible, the best. Research shows that more than 80% of the high school student have felt the pressure of having to have better qualifications than their peers. Unfortunately, when they haven\u2019t, this has had a negative impact on their mental health, making them feel they were not enough, or that they were not worthy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been observed, that in those educational methods, such as Montessori or Regio Emilia, in which the focus is on cooperation, there is no willingness to be the best in the class. Instead of that, there is ambition for achieving goals, but always working together as a team and making contributions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the current competitive education systems must be reconsidered. Although, being competitive is not a negative attribute, in my opinion in schools the pupils should be educated to work together and show the power of teamwork.'",

Although many folks agree that they should be paid by the government I strongly believe that taking care of their own family should not be a burden to the state.\r\n\r\nHaving a family can be difficult especially if the parents are working at the same time. One way or the other, there should be a time when both partners will decide who will stay home to take care of the family especially if they have children. This said, the moms usually stay home because they know better how to take care of their kids. Therefore, the government has nothing to do with the decisions the parents make for the family. And also it\u2019s the responsibility of the mother to stay home and look after the kids to make sure they are safe and sound.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, If the government will pay for the salaries of each and every mother staying at home, this will be a big cut on the budget that needs to be funded for other needs of the people. And instead of helping the mothers this might cause a bad reputation as it can trigger laziness and early pregnancies. For example, a study shows that in the Philippines, teenage marriage is increasing because the government are supporting them in terms of giving cash aid, as a result, instead of studying in school most are getting married at a very young age because they know that the government will help them.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is the mothers\u2019 choice to take care of the family and I believe that the government do not need to pay them as it is their responsibility and it will create a bad image to others, especially to the young female students.'",

This is because , for the being time, most of the big and popular schools have their own dress code. In addition to that, there are various students from different families. What I mean by that is not all individuals have enough money to buy many clothes. Therefore, wearing the same uniform is beneficial for these people.\r\n\r\n   On the other hand, as the coin has 2 sides, it has a plethora of demerits too. First of all, the outfit of students does not have any influence on their knowledge or the way they learn something, not even a bad impact. However, there are some teens that the appearance of themself is crucial. Thus, when they put on something that they do not like, it may have a negative influence on their mood.

Current findings suggest that more business-related talks, meet-ups and teachings happen virtually. The below essay will elaborate further on the merits and demerits of the above notion.\r\n\r\nOn one hand,  online gatherings in business have the advantage  that shareholders or workers can do wherever they might be without travelling which saves time and money at the same time. Furthermore, it is cheaper as there would be no rental fees and refreshments involved in conducting the agenda of that day. Additionally, it is good for the environment as it eliminates fuel pollution from those who might be going to the gathering. Meetings can be recorded and kept in  cyberspace without any inconvenience and it can accommodate more individuals without an expensive venue. For example, in zoom meetings about 1000 people can join and it eliminates the spreading of diseases . \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are quite a number of negative effects such as signal loss, for example, in Zimbabwe, there are power shortages which will now require additional sources to make it for the meeting. Moreover, there is a loss in the transport industry as they would have gained by transporting those people to the venue.

A further disadvantage is that the elderly are more likely to face health issues and because of their huge population, there will be a lack of sufficient medical facilities like hospitals and demands for medications will soar sharply.

For instance, most European people bully the Asian visitors because of racism. In my opinion, Asian people have brown and blonde coloured faces, which is the biggest reason.\r\n\r\n However, countries can reduce it by the same products to the opposition of racism. For example, nowadays, individuals tend to do skin care more frequently. This leads to reduced differences between the five continents. Therefore, in this way, it can be the greatest approach.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, the diversity of culture plays an essential role in highlighting countries. The prevalence of uniform products throughout the world poses a significant challenge to cultural diversity. If the world is becoming more and more similar, they do not have any differences from each other. It is likely to be one country.

Furthermore, even if the said population knows about the impact it has on the body, the withdrawal caused by  nicotine addiction leads to important mood swings and terrible pain, which no one wants to deal with. For instance, a study led by Harvard University in 2021 in China, the country with the largest population of smokers, showed that 60% of the surveyed Chinese are well aware of the consequences on their bodies, yet they express the need to satisfy their nicotine cravings. \r\n\r\nAn effective solution to this problem would revolve around the creation of a campaign. Moreover, creating publicities is a good way to have an impact on individuals since marketing strategies use sociological approaches in order to influence any opinion. This solution could help in having an influence on those who have a smoking addiction. For example, in 2017, the French government launched a campaign called \u201cLook at the Kid\u201d. The purpose was to impact couples that smoked and target the potential desire to have a child. The publicity series was successful, leading to a decrease in the quantity of French smokers by 5% in 8 months. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, this problem is caused by the addictive aspect of smoking but can be resolved thanks to the use of publicity strategies.'",

What are some possible solutions?' \n 'Text': 'In this day and age,  it is considered by a plethora of individuals that, elders have difficulty acclimating to new high-tech devices. The main cause of this is the novel nature of the technology revolution and the best solutions involve education.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the elderly have trouble catching up with new developments in technology because computers and the internet are fundamentally novel. Furthermore, laptops require a skill set that is completely foreign to humans who did not grow up in the last 30 years. To utilize these kinds of gadgets, one must be able to type, set up online accounts, recall passwords, troubleshoot IT problems and navigate both the internet and a wide range of internet-based apps. For those born into the internet era, this is all second nature, but for others, the learning curve is often too steep. The simple process of turning on these sorts of appliances and locating programs exploiting an unfamiliar interface can be overwhelming and serves as the principal, initial barrier.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the best solutions for this relate to education. Firstly, older people who are still working require special training programs and patience from their employers and themselves. Competence is likely given detailed instructions and enough time to practice. Secondly, a great deal of retired citizens want to spend more time with their kids, grandchildren and old friends, but it can be difficult to travel, particularly if they live far apart. Old-timers would be enormously motivated to make video calls and keep in touch with familiar ones with applications like Skype, Facetime and so on. Through simple instructions from family members, it is possible that video-conferencing could become a routine task.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, elders today often can not understand the machinery because it is a seismic shift in perspective and the solutions involve patient training at work and home. In this way, the benefits of technology can be extended to a generation that missed out on them in their youth.'",

Some societies have a notion that it can result in increased quality of life and people live longer compared to the past. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will delve into the salient impacts that modern science has on individuals and societies as a whole.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is evident that we live in a digital and modernized world. Thus, all the things that surround us develop constantly and these improvements have wide-ranging effects on healthcare, like in all fields. Initially, robots can participate in delicate surgeries, reducing the risk of human error and increasing patient outcomes. Furthermore, today, more and more laboratories have a plethora of experiments to generate and improve the quality of medicines. \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the consequences of modern medical science are manifold and invaluable. Hence, the enhancements in healthcare can directly affect people, providing them with fast and painless services. Perhaps an eminent example of this would be the surgeries when the doctors use lasers and they make operations less painful, diminishing the time required to heal. Additionally, the potential positive results from the medicine trials may pave the way for accelerating the healing process. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed this phenomenon, it is important to emphasize that the good repercussions of modern science on medical care are far-reaching and cannot be ignored. Scientists should continue their practices on medicines and technology to stave off diseases, mitigating the dire ramifications of traditional medicine while protecting the posterity from possible threats.'",

Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether it is better to settle down at an earlier age or leave it  after 21. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay, I would contend that working on goals and postponing marriage even after 25 would lead to more successful and happier consequences.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that rather than concentrating on getting married at a younger age, determining goals and working hard to achieve them should be a priority in humans\u2019 lives. In order to have a more successful marriage, gaining skills or academic education related to the dream job, which enables individuals to have a higher salary and a wealthy life is more advisable. Otherwise, it would lead to economic dependency on parents, which, contributes to unappealing feelings and loss of confidence.\r\n\r\nSecondly and even more importantly, though, is the fact that due to the lack of knowledge and experience, starting a family from less than 21 years old would result in disadvantageous ramifications. According to the statistics, the number of divorces among couples less than 25 was 10 times higher than those higher than 25 in 2021 in Iran country. So, before getting married, gaining a job and engaging in social life would lead to the expansion of the horizon of thinking and opting more logically in the process of marriage.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although settling down from under 21 would be accompanied by some benefits, the irreparable drawbacks seen in most cases are incomparable with those benefits. Thus, regulating a legal age for marriage would contribute to the advancement of societies.'",

Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether this is a positive or negative trend. While there are valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that the advantages of the ageing population are incomparable with its drawbacks. Two of the primary reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that providing the opportunity to utilize these generations\u2019 experiences in various aspects of managing a country could be accounted as an invaluable asset. According to the statistics, a salient example of this could be Japan country, which, rehires retired individuals in more prominent management positions in order to gain the most efficient benefits. So rather than viewing them as  outdated people, providing the opportunity to implement their worthwhile ideas would contribute to benefit the whole country.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this opinion is the fact that despite the expenses spent for their treatment or their insurance, they could play a supportive role for their children and grandchildren. As the expenditure of life has soared in recent years and both parents have to work in order to afford the costs of life, grandparents could take the responsibility of caring for their children. So, implementing more effectively at work is more likely as worries related to the care of children are alleviated by the support of elders.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that the ageing population is accounted as the grace of god.

However, there are plenty of schools where students are allowed to dress what they want. In this following essay, I shall express the merits and demerits of wearing a uniform.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several examples of this statement. The prime advantages are the elimination of social and economic differences and instilling discipline. First and foremost, when all the students wear the same clothes, they look alike and a sense of equality is created among them. For instance, with the same dress code, it becomes sophisticated for others to know the social and economic status of kids. This saves poor juniors from bullying or partiality. Secondly, it helps to instil discipline in children because the dress costume obliges them to comply with the rules and regulations of an academy. As an example, if a student is found smoking or wearing a school uniform, then they can be punished as per the academy's regulations as this implies that the act was committed even after being aware of the regulations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a great deal of ideas for this viewpoint. The foremost disadvantage is that it suppresses the kid's creativity and individuality. It is widely accepted that creativity is needed in every sphere of life to be successful. A youngster needs to create a bridge between  creativity and knowledge to discover something new. For example, kids will not be able to highlight themselves and experiment and they will lose out on thinking out of the box. Multiple studies prove that the mandatory status of uniforms may turn children into passive youth who cannot express themselves via their dressing style. Therefore, it is significant to enhance  creativity and individuality while their personalities are still developing.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, putting on a school uniform can be beneficial as it allows to diminish the social and economic divides. In addition, it should not be forgotten that it limits the creativity of a young mind.'",

They tend to use whatever they find trend by seeing its adverts. Additionally, a lack of information about the negative points of fast food can be another cause of people's unhealthy choices. As a matter of fact, fast food manufacturers do not attempt to inform their customers about the inadequate quality of their products. For instance, the high amount of fat in fast food which will bring obesity is not mentioned anywhere in users' information.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is self-evident that governments must prepare some TV programs and environmental adverts to reintroduce traditional food to the younger generation and encourage them to choose healthier alternatives. If high-quality food had as much advertisement as fast food, it would definitely attract customers' attention. Moreover, writing about the harmful factors of each kind of fast food on the pack  in order to inform people about the long-term effects on their health will let them choose their diet wisely.

This surge in curiosity can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the desire to connect with the past and understand the lineage of one's dwelling plays a pivotal role in driving this inclination. By delving into the history of their homes, people seek to establish a sense of belonging and identity rooted in the narratives of previous occupants and the surrounding community. Moreover, the resurgence of architectural appreciation has fueled this trend. With an increased appreciation for craftsmanship and design, individuals are motivated to explore the origins of their residences, thereby gaining insight into the architectural evolution of their locality. Furthermore, the advent of technology has facilitated easy access to historical records and archives, enabling people to embark on comprehensive research journeys from the comfort of their homes. Online databases, digitized records, and virtual tours offer invaluable resources for individuals eager to unravel the past of their dwellings. To delve deeper into the history of their houses or buildings, people can employ various research methodologies. This may involve consulting local archives, historical societies, or municipal records to unearth documents such as property deeds, census data, or architectural plans. Additionally, engaging with local historians, conducting interviews with previous occupants, or utilizing genealogical resources can provide valuable insights into the lineage and anecdotes associated with the residence. In conclusion, the burgeoning interest in investigating the history of residences stems from a desire for connection, architectural appreciation, and technological advancements. Through meticulous research efforts, individuals can unravel the rich tapestry of narratives embedded within the walls of their homes, fostering a deeper appreciation for their heritage and sense of place.'",

Some people have a notion that the burgeoning popularity of the internet can lead to the loss of interest in newspapers. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will elucidate the reasons why I partially agree with this opinion and provide a reasonable conclusion from my standpoint.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is undeniable that the internet has became an undisputable part of our daily lives. People of all ages utilize social media platforms to make connections with each other, share cherished moments and keep up with the events which occur all around the world. Perhaps the eminent examples of this would be the online formats of magazines such as The Forbes and The Times. While the readers have a chance to reach them online, they may find it preferable.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the paradigm, the older generation's priorities and preferences can can be various, in terms of using mediums. They do not only read magazines and newspapers to be aware of the daily news but also use it as a way to unwind their mind during the reading process. Furthermore, some people of old age do not know how they can appropriately use the websites, or even do not have any electronic devices to access the internet.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this phenomenon, I cannot concur with this idea wholeheartedly in the wake of the above-mentioned reasons.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'In this day and age, more companies are making attempts to recruit and retain the differences between the total of female and male employees to the least. However, in my opinion, it can be possible in some specific fields, and the overwhelming sum of males is inevitable in physical jobs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I accept that modern workplaces in some domains such as the service industry and paperwork are likely to have  equal statistics of male and female workers. In fact, in many organizations these days, more job vacancies are available for girls than in the past, meaning that women nowadays can have the same opportunities as boys to be employed in some positions, even taking  leadership. Besides, with outstanding and special human instincts, aesthetic abilities or detail-oriented personalities, for example,  girls can even do better than boys in some specific careers, contributing to an increase in the number of ladies in modern workplaces.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I argue that it seems to be challenging and impossible to maintain the equivalent numbers of male and female employees in jobs requiring physical health. As a matter of fact, careers such as astronauts  have very high requirements for physical health in order to deal with intensive training and tough conditions without gravity when taking a mission to explore a new planet, so it is likely to be more suitable for guys than females. In addition, regarding some manual work in society such as builders and porters, although a few women can be recruited for these vacancies, the sum of men by far outweighs that of ladies since males seem to be stronger and healthier to do the jobs more efficiently. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, maintaining an equal figure of fathers and females in workplaces should be highly recommended, further, I am still more convinced that it can just be feasible in some industries, and with careers whose prerequisite requirement is good health and fitness, it is unavoidable to witness a surpassing figure of persons compared with mothers.'",

Some of the reasons behind this fad is because of the quality of luxury goods and the influence of famous artists and I think that this is a negative development because this can lead to debts. \r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why many prefer to buy branded material is because of their quality. Despite its expensive price, it can be used for a long time, thus, the consumers get value for their money. In addition to that, artists can influence the choices of the community. Many celebrities are posting their lavish lifestyle on social media and they get many likes from all over the world. That is why their followers tend to follow them because many of them think that it can make them famous as well. For instance, Kylie Jenner is one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram and her followers buy all the expensive brands she posts in the hopes that they get many likes as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that this is a negative development because this may lead to the accumulation of debts. Many populations may feel unsatisfied about their life and they might feel that the only way to be happy is by having luxury finished goods. As a result, they can end up in debt in order to achieve these things. For example, most crowds nowadays are in excessive debt because of buying luxury brands so that other folks think that they are classy. Hence, buying expensive products more than one's financial capacity is not a good thing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many populations are buying expensive brands for many reasons and some of them are because of the quality and the influence of celebrities.

Although there may be valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay, I would contend that the drawbacks associated with this trend are incomparable with the benefits. Two primary reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that the relocation of the rural population to urban areas for the sake of better life facilities would lead to a recession in the agriculture industry. A salient example of this is Tehran the capital of Iran where according to the statistics more than half of the villages remained isolated in 2017 and the production of agricultural products declined by 20 percent. Furthermore, it is obvious that continuing this phenomenon would result in the integration of new movers into modern urban culture and forgetting the national cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nSecondly and even more importantly though, is the fact that the climb in the number of the urban population would disrupt the balance between the supply and demand, in destination cities. People will compete for staples like employment or owning a home. so, predictable would be inflation as well as unemployment and criminal behaviours in urban regions. Admittedly growth in traffic congestion, air pollution and water pollution is more likely to appear following this trend.\r\n\r\nBy the way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although a wide range of facilities are concentrated in urban areas, which, attract many people to those places, the mentioned drawbacks would be insurmountable in the foreseeable future.

Both sides of the argument will first be elaborated on before explaining why, ultimately, I side with the latter.\r\n\r\nOne view is that films can be fully enjoyed on small screens, such as phones or tablets. The main reason for this is the convenience. With the proliferation of streaming services, it is easier than ever to access films on small screens, and individuals can watch them wherever and whenever they like. For example, someone could log into Netflix on their phone and watch the latest release during their daily commute by train. Additionally, small screens may provide a more intimate viewing experience, as individuals can watch films in their own space and at their own pace.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also several reasons why opponents believe films may need to be seen in a cinema in order to be fully enjoyed. One is the enhanced visual and audio experience that a theatre can provide. With larger screens and better sound systems, motion pictures can be more immersive and impactful in a cinema setting. Many cinema complexes now offer even 4D options that have moving seats to make the viewer feel like they are part of the action.  Furthermore, the social aspect of watching films in a cinema can be a key part of the enjoyment, as individuals can share the experience with others and engage in discussions about the film afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although both arguments are logical, in my view, the enhanced visual and audio experience, as well as the social aspect, can be key to fully appreciating a film. I believe that with excessive media options available on mobile devices, recapturing the romance of a trip to the theatre with loved ones should be cherished.'",

What are the main effects of this epidemic?' \n 'Text': 'Over the past decades, the number of overweight people has increased, and this trend is being observed nowadays. This essay will discuss the main reasons for this epidemic and then describe the possible effects of the problem.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the foremost causes of obesity are an inactive lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. Today, more and more people rely on cars instead of walking, have fewer physical demands at work, and prefer inactive leisure activities. This results in burning fewer calories and gaining weight. Moreover, the problem is accentuated by the growing number of people who eat irregularly and consume large portions of high-calorie food. For example, about 50% of the adult population in Europe suffers from being overweight due to disordered eating habits.\r\n\r\nThe possible effects of this problem include physical health problems and loss of productivity. Firstly, obesity results in the incorrect functioning of the human body and contributes to the risk of developing some chronic illnesses. For example, as body fat percentage increases, the person's metabolism worsens, which in turn may result in diabetes or heart disease. Furthermore, overweight people are very unhealthy and often suffer from stress and tiredness. This lessens their work capacity and leads to lower productivity. For instance, it has been proven that an obese person needs to put more effort into completing some tasks than a person with normal weight.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, obesity is a big issue that affects a lot of people nowadays. It is mainly caused by inactive lifestyles and eating disorders and has a detrimental impact on severe health problems and loss of productivity.'",

The variety of smartphones\u2019 uses may contribute to this case and I feel that this is harmful to children\u2019s health.\r\n\r\nI think this situation may be caused by the development of smartphones and it is also partly because children can not limit themselves. Children can not restrict themselves well so they are likely to be fascinated by interesting things. With the evolution of smartphones, today children can get a good kick out of them , they can play games, find interesting things, watch films and TV series as well as read stories on mobile phones. As a result, children, the people who are not able to control themselves well, will be fully attracted to smartphones. For instance, if they do each thing for an hour per day, then the total time will become at least four hours--it is long enough for children. \r\n\r\nThis case is projected to pose a threat to children\u2019s health. Everyone has only 24 hours per day, so if children pay closer attention to playing on mobile , they will have fewer hours to exercise . Then this will lead to a weak body and it will be easy for them to catch an illness. And it is believed that using smartphones too often is responsible for bad eyesight. If we allow kids to spend too much time utilising phones, they will have to wear a pair of glasses at an early age.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the reason why children spend a long time on smartphones is the many uses of smartphones and their lack of self-control and this will present a challenge to their health.'",

If you look at most of the well-paid job advertisements in various applications or websites, the minimum requirement for applying for these positions is having relevant university-certified qualifications. For example, to become a successful lawyer or doctor, one should study at a prestigious university and obtain the necessary certification. Moreover, many educational institutions provide their students with appropriate apprenticeships after graduation,offering valuable insights into career prospects and the work environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having relevant experience in a real-world environment can help candidates develop essential personality traits such as strong interpersonal skills, leadership skills and the ability to work efficiently in a team.

This essay discusses the reasons behind this phenomenon and the solutions to the matter.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why employees do not do physical activities regularly. The first of these is due to poor time management. This is because workers often schedule too many daily activities and end up not accomplishing some personal ones. For instance, home-based job workers often have trouble finishing tasks earlier to do their daily workouts. Moreover, tiredness is another common reason why people skip exercising. The reason for this is that workers usually finish their professional duties at night when they are too exhausted to go to the gym and, therefore, they might choose to spend the rest of the day resting.\r\n\r\nHowever, some strategies might help mitigate these difficulties. Firstly, one should try exercising before engaging in their job. This is due to recent studies that have shown that working out in the morning brings more consistency to people's health routine since they usually feel more energetic at this time of the day. For example, the elderly tend to do physical activities in the morning because it is when their bodies are fully rested. Furthermore, having a gym partner helps the individual commit to their workout schedule. This is because doing sports can be more fun with a friend. In particular, workout partners can serve as mental support when one's lacking motivation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons why workers are skipping their exercise are related to poor time management and exhaustion after working all day. The possible solutions to this matter are going to the gym before work commitments and gathering workout partners.'",

In your opinion, what are the major benefits and drawbacks of hosting an international sporting event such as the World Cup?' \n 'Text': 'International sporting games are the principal chance for viewers to enjoy their favourite sports, the king sport like football is not an exception. Besides that, when a famous and huge undertaking happens, it contributes to the hosting countries not only gaining massive positive aspects but also disadvantages mentioned in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a country can own the polity to organize a global game that helps their nation achieve many advantages through this event. On top of that, the sporting games bring a significant economic promotion to the host. People invest a massive part of the government budget to erect infrastructure, facilities, and accommodations for competitors and visitors. In addition, hosting residents can have a wonderful chance to sell local products and advertise their speciality to tourists and viewers. Furthermore, inhabitants can have more opportunities to exchange their culture and traditions with others in the world. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is undoubted that the hosting nation also suffers some disadvantages from organizing a huge sporting event. Firstly, they spend much more of their money on the sporting sector resulting in a lack of financial resources for others. Secondly, the routine residents\u2019 lives may be distracted by massive domestic and international viewers, especially elders. Besides that, to ensure the security of competitors and participants, especially politicians or governmental people, organizers utilize a massive security operation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many countries hope to set up an international sporting event such as the World Cup to achieve surplus advantages outweighing to disadvantages for the locals.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinions' \n 'Text': 'There has been much debate regarding the role of famous people in raising public awareness of the major problems. While some contend that celebrities can attract people\u2019s attention to  problems, others believe that they can make them less critical. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, supporters argue that endorsements of international aid organizations by figures draw attention to pressing global issues. Celebrities often have large platforms and widespread influence which they can leverage to raise public awareness and mobilize resources for humanitarian causes. To illustrate, a well-known Vietnamese singer named Thuy Tien used her fame to raise a fund of two million dollars to assist citizens who suffered heavily from natural disasters. Additionally, the superstar can use their status to advocate for policy changes and drive fundraising efforts, resulting in tangible support for affected communities.\r\n\r\nConversely, critics comment that celebrity involvement in international assistance can sometimes overshadow the subjects themselves and detract from more substantial solutions. There is concern that focusing on celebrity endorsement may create a superficial understanding of  complex matters, leading to tokenistic gestures and short-term solutions rather than addressing the root causes. Moreover, although initial attention to a cause can spike due to celebrity endorsement, there is the risk that this consideration may not be sustained over time. Once the star moves on to another cause or project, the public\u2019s interest may wane, leaving organizations without the needed long-term support.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the impact of celebrity involvement in international aid organizations is nuanced and context-dependent. Whilst celebrities can undoubtedly bring attention to important issues and mobilize resources, their engagement should be approached with caution and critical scrutiny. It is essential to ensure that their involvement is genuine, informed, and respectful of the communities they seek to support. In addition, efforts should be made to amplify the voices of local activists and institutions working on the ground, as they often possess invaluable insights and solutions tailored to their specific contexts. Ultimately, effective advocacy and support for international aid require a collaborative and inclusive approach that prioritizes the dignity, agency, and empowerment of affected communities.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Overpopulated countries experience severe pressure on local transportation systems these days. One path to resolve the issue is to develop public transport networks like a subway. It is agreed that the metro is the best way to get around big cities. This essay will highlight some advantages of underground trains and provide several examples to support the points.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, a well-designed underground train network can drastically reduce pressure on an overwhelmed road system. For instance, over the last several decades, Singapore has diminished the total traffic level by fifty-two per cent by launching new underground transportation lines. Before these changes, the city experienced severe jams even at night, and such change was warmly embraced by society. Thus, Singapore's experience can be a good example for mayors of all cities in the world.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the majority of subway systems worldwide are electric-based facilities which do not exert additional pressure on the Earth's finite, depleting resources. For example, according to a study conducted at the University of North Carolina, the average citizen who prefers public electrical transport like a metro produces seventy per cent less carbon dioxide compared to his vehicle-driving neighbour. As a result, underground movements are not only the fastest manner to reach the destination point but also a convenient way to save the planet.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the underground is a great example of a modern and effective means of transportation which solves not only traffic problems in metropolises but preserves our planet too. All together, the aforementioned benefits make the subway the best alternative to move across cities now and in the future. It is predicted that electric underground train networks will steadily supersed personal vehicles in the foreseeable future.'",

Some people think that humans should stop using oil, gas and coal and switch to alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. Others claim that fossil fuels are essential for many industries, and not using them will result in economic recession.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion?\r\n\r\nSupport your point of view with relevant examples.' \n 'Text': 'Climate change is one of the largest challenges that people face in this century. However, this is a controversial topic due to the varying opinions of differing groups. One mode of thought, which prevails in the popular mood, is for the onset of renewables on an industrial scale. Contrastingly, others believe fossil fuels are necessary to maintain the current economic system. In my opinion, the use of sustainable sources should be given priority. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the abusive nature of oil and gas leads to a deterioration of the environment, which has been  evidenced in recent times. For example, the rising global temperatures are causing the ice caps to melt which are impacting the level of the oceans, which in turn, are precipitating adverse weather conditions in many parts of the world. Under these circumstances, using clean energy is a necessity, rather than a choice. Moreover, climate change is here in the present and not in a distant future. The effects of this phenomenon are now visible. As an example, studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between unusual weather conditions and increased heat. \r\n\r\nSecondly, alternative sources of energy can be made economically viable in the long run. To begin with, the exploitation of such energies will give rise to new industries. This, in turn, will result in more employment opportunities. Furthermore, new research can help in making these energies more efficient so that they can be used in traditional industries. For instance, in countries like Germany and the Netherlands, wind power is extensively used by households and the manufacturing industry. Thus, with time, renewable fuels can contribute to the development of the economy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think alternative modes of power should be reinforced in the forthcoming decades, due to all the advantages they will create.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'In life education and sports play an important role. However, some parents argue that parents should urge their children to engage in more physical activity rather than studying academic subjects. I completely agree with this notion and the reasons for my opinion will be illustrated in the forthcoming paragraph with relevant illustrations.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, to achieve anything you must remain healthy. To emphasize, physical activity provides more opportunities for individuals to become strong. As a result, it allows students to study more and enhances children's health. Even if a student has an excellent academic performance in daily life, his grade will be affected if he suffers from several health conditions. Therefore, it is essential to maintain physical fitness to perform better in all situations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, playing more games may inspire an interest in their communication skills and improve their social circle, as the majority of games include teamwork. To explain, when youths have the chance to play with other team members, they have a greater chance to interact with a different personality.  For instance, a game of hockey requires six players. Teammates must develop positive relationships with one another, which leads to a greater understanding of each individual's activities and interests. Therefore, it is essential to devote more time to physical activities to become involved in the world.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that parents should encourage their children to devote more time to outdoor activities than to academics, as the fact that physical activity keeps the human body fit and provides opportunities to interact with others.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is sometimes argued that parents should convince their kids to take the time to do physical activities rather than study. Personally, I completely agree with the statement for several reasons which will be given out in this essay. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it can be said with certainty that regular physical exercises are essential for maintaining both mental and physical condition. By this, I mean that doing these could lead to better sleep patterns, promoting deeper and restful sleep, and positively impacting mental strength. Furthermore, engaging in physical activities promotes overall physical well-being, as offspring participate in sports and exercises, thereby reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues. For instance, in Asia, where kids spend most of their time studying, developing the risk of health problems, often resulting in sleep deprivation and stress. Therefore, it is essential for parents to support their children in balancing between studying and staying healthy. \r\n\r\nSecondly, a special consideration is that joining a team sport would allow kids to develop important social skills. The main basis is probably because a team sport would offer increased opportunities to meet new people, creating environments for children to communicate, cooperate and engage in teamwork. To illustrate this, consider the case of badminton, there are two individuals in one team, highlighting the significance of cooperation and teamwork in securing the top prize. Therefore, the advantages of doing physical activities far outweigh those of studying. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe parents should encourage children to be aware of spending more time exercising due to the benefits of fitness and social skills.'",

What is the most important element you think to make a perfect society? How do people do to achieving an ideal society?' \n 'Text': 'Most people in the world have a dream to live in an ideal society and lead a happy meaningful life. However, they do not have the same idea about what a perfect civilization would look like. I personally think that there are two indicators that can measure the perfection of a society in the modern world: proper infrastructure and employment opportunity. This essay discusses these factors and the ways to achieve that ideal association followed by examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly, a perfect community must possess robust infrastructure and efficient services to meet the fundamental needs of its inhabitants. Take folks living in Melbourne as an example, Melbourne is claimed as the most livable city in the world and the citizens can be classified as living an ideal way of life. This city boasts a multitude of modern foundation elements, including state-of-the-art public health centres, schools, bus stops, and various other essential facilities. Additionally, the city offers excellent services at the airport and local government offices. These optimal conditions are made possible when citizens consistently pay their taxes and adhere to the established regulations. Tax revenue serves as a valuable resource for developing sophisticated public facilities. When the community follows these regulations, they can expect high-quality sustenance for its residents.\r\n\r\nSecondly, An ideal community requires an ample number of job opportunities to cater for the demands of its people. Adequate job prospects provide individuals with a satisfactory income and the promise of a promising career. Take Los Angeles, for instance, where the majority of the population dedicates a significant portion of their time to work and enjoys favourable financial conditions. Such a scenario can be established within a society if its citizens are encouraged to become entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship opens up new employment avenues, ultimately reducing unemployment rates and fostering economic growth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a perfect civilization must possess comprehensive infrastructure, essential servings, and ample employment opportunities. This condition can be cultivated through tax contributions, policy compliance, and the creation of job opportunities by entrepreneurs.'",

In my opinion, while some personal characteristics can cause people to commit a crime, education and parental upbringing play a role in preventing children from criminal activities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEngaging in criminal activities can result from some personal traits. Initially, when acting as selfish and arrogant people, individuals may consider a right for themselves to carry out any activity without considering regulations or even others' advice. For example, in Vietnam, studies indicated that criminals who were arrested presented rarely\u00a0 disciplined behaviour during their childhood due to the schools' records. Moreover, as people may be irresponsible in both their social and personal lives, they are less likely to think about their social status, thus not respecting laws or others' rights. Ultimately, because people may be brought up with the features of impatience and intolerance, they may be unable to handle hard situations, especially\u00a0 economic issues, leading to a temptation to satisfy their needs illegally.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, teachers and parents should take the responsibility to teach children to abide laws. In the first place, as a school is like a minor society to live life, teachers should set the rules for the classes, which if children do not follow, they will be confronted with a mild punishment. Students, therefore, will practise to respect laws to avoid negative consequences. Furthermore, were children not to come from a family where the parents themselves broke laws, they would not be potentially prepared to ignore regulations in society. This is because there is a\u00a0 close between parental upbringing and children's personality. For instance, in accordance with a study in Japan, a large proportion of criminals belonged to unstable families which had experienced crimes to accommodate their needs. Consequently, parents should be extremely concerned about the environment, in which children are brought up. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it may be acceptable\u00a0 that people with a few characteristics have more potential for offensive behaviour, it is hard to deny the roles of families and schools to learn how to respect laws as well as citizens' rights.'",

What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?' \n 'Text': 'In recent times, the number of people who tend to run their own businesses has increased significantly. This is owing to the fact that  job independence brings great  benefits to the owner in terms of economic aspects and having a flexible timetable. I would argue that this trend has its own disadvantages which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. \r\n\r\nOne of the primary rationales behind the increasing preference for self-employment is the strong desire for independence and control over your time. To elaborate on my point, if you work on your own, you might have the capability to manage your schedules geared to your lifestyle. What it means is that  there is no obligation to be in your workplace at a certain time. For instance, being freelance can pave the way for earning more money since the profits are not shared with an employer. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, embarking on a self-employment journey also entails a set of distinct drawbacks. To present a better explanation, one of the primary problems is the absence of job security and benefits typically provided by traditional employment including health insurance and paid leave. Furthermore, statistics show that  business owners might have to deal with more stress as it is challenging to maintain a work-life balance. To cite an example, one of my friends started up  her online shop. After a while, she had a panic attack as she was so  agitated about paying  her debts and she was fully responsible for all the work ranging from financial management and customer service.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, having an independent occupation can be rewarding regarding financial issues and flexibility.

For example, the advice often given to graduates, suggesting they pursue secure and conventional careers like administration or teaching, is increasingly irrelevant. The advent of the Internet and other technological advancements have expanded the array of career opportunities. Moreover, forcing young women to marry partners they have no emotional connection with is considered conservative, as they now possess the right to choose their life partners.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, numerous traditional ideas retain their relevance and should be revered. For instance, the timeless wisdom that success is achieved through self-learning and hard work remains indispensable for the youth, given the ever-competitive job market. In addition, traditional values of politeness and good manners are invaluable in the contemporary world, where individuals from diverse backgrounds often collaborate and interact.

Some people suggest that this phenomenon is bad progress while I personally believe that the progress of international corporations should not be deemed as a negative fact.  \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why people think that the growth of international companies is a negative trend. Firstly, the development of local businesses will be negatively affected because global companies give a competitive price to customers. In general, transnational corporations have an advanced position to negotiate the price of raw materials due to the vast demand, therefore, the cost of production is much lower than small local firms, and thus the selling price to clients is more competitive. Secondly, it can lead to market unfairness if international companies become stronger. Giant global firms develop their business in different areas, and they can take an unfair advantage to win more clients through their close relationships with governments and counterparties. For instance, some big international banks obtain some proficient policies from local governments by providing senior positions to some public officers\u2019 relatives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I stand with these people who believe that it is a positive development that global firms are increasingly powerful.

For example, the extent of  farming produced is reduced drastically because of the shortfall in labour which will accumulate year by year and become unsurmountable.The outcome of the spending power for the remnant will make living in rural areas unviable.\r\n\r\nAnother bleak outcome is sociological in nature because migrations to urban areas are undertaken by younger men and women, leading to a predominance of senior citizens who are left behind to manage household affairs. More often than not this leads to a weak and helpless community who cannot do more than the bare minimum maintenance tasks. As a result, facilities in the countryside, like parks, hospitals, schools, roads etc become rundown and look poverty-stricken. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the problem of the countryside being depleted of population due to migration is harmful to that part of any nation and has to be rectified. In the above paragraphs, we have seen two such issues out of many more possible deteriorating outcomes and we can conclude that unless there is a concerted intervention by the governments of various countries, the problems of  the countryside will be exacerbated.'",

There is no reason that some people try to prevent this from happening. Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is argued that animal extinction is a natural process, so humans have no justifiable reason to avert it. I disagree with this notion.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the disappearance of certain animals such as dinosaurs and dodos is considered natural because it occurs without direct human influence, like asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions, so it cannot be prevented. However, I am convinced that it remains our responsibility to prevent this phenomenon from happening. Specifically, there is no denying that human activities, such as deforestation and industrial pollution, have led to habitat loss and pollution, which are the primary reasons for animal extinction. Since humans are the drivers of ecological destruction, it is their duty to ensure animals\u2019 existence. By doing so, we are not only fulfilling our moral duty toward nature, but we are also helping create a planet full of diversity for future generations to appreciate.\r\n\r\nIn addition, apart from fulfilling our ethical responsibility, I am sure that our efforts to halt animals\u2019 death may open new avenues for scientific discoveries, which could bring immense benefits to mankind. For instance, the Sumatran Orangutan, a highly endangered species today, is worth protecting. If we ignore them, we will not be able to utilize them when conducting scientific research involving evolution and genetics. When this happens, understanding their close genetic relationship with humans as well as the possibility of scientific breakthroughs like cloning or medical advancements will not be possible.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although I find it admissible that certain animals no longer exist due to natural reasons, we must still recognize our ethical responsibility and animals\u2019 potential contributions to scientific discovery, so we should exert more effort on protecting them than neglecting them.'",

Some people believe that their health depends on suggestions from doctors, so they do not keep their good physical condition by themselves. Although there are several problems, there will be a variety of possible solutions to overcome them.\r\n\r\nThe first aspect to identify is that the cost of health will increase if society only depends on the doctor. In fact, medical costs in some countries are exceedingly high and all poor communities do not have access to adequate treatment even if they need it. consequently, the number of deaths will grow in some countries. Another important issue is that if all patients who have mild illnesses are hospitalized due to a lack of independent care at home, therefore the availability of hospital beds for nations who need fast immediate care will decrease. Those phenomena could have a small group of negative impacts on association in terms of equality of opportunities and medical care. \r\n\r\neven though these two problems may be unavoidable, there are various solutions for them. Firstly, the civilizations need to be educated on how to maintain their good physical condition day-to-day. For example, TV shows have an enormous impact because everyone watches them in the house. If there are a number of educational programs related to well-being and physical fitness, an individual would learn how to change the daily habit of eating to keep away from the problem of healthiness. Secondly, the government must give an opportunity to humanity to increase their welfare at local facilities. For instance, in Japan, there are a few educational meetings at local facilities given to the public on how to avoid obesity or how to maintain good conditions during pregnancy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are several problems in society if people are very dependent on doctors regarding the cost of treatment and the availability of beds in hospitals, but several solutions to overcome this negative trend. If the government tries to educate the public about the importance of maintaining physical health, then this problem will be resolved.'",

This has led to the division of society into 2 groups: those who believe that these changes are beneficial in many ways, while others are worried about our dependence on innovations. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and share my outlook.\r\n\r\n           It is true that people are gradually losing control over their lifestyle to technology. One of the reasons is an addiction to social media. Although it takes little time to watch one video or read a post, algorithms will recommend the ones that we might like the most, resulting in constant scrolling over hours. For instance, some teenagers find themselves consuming content past their bedtime, causing a reduction in time spent on sleeping and, consequently, health and productivity issues. Moreover, humanity has learned to store many pieces of data that otherwise we would have to remember by ourselves. For example, previously, if a person would want to go home with a taxi they would need to have their home address remembered, while now an application on a smartphone already has that information written on its memory. This can potentially lead to the degradation of the brain's abilities to memorise and not forget. \r\n\r\n      On the other hand, despite some disadvantages, I agree with the positive view of advancement. In particular possibility to work, shop and study anywhere as long as there is a connection to the internet, which can free an office worker from the stress and time wastage that comes with commuting or queuing in shops which can be reattributed towards having a rest, taking care of family and other things that can make a person happy. Besides, it helps us to learn and study without having to travel to attend lectures, thus making education more affordable.\r\n\r\n        In conclusion, even though both opinions are relevant, I believe that technology is mostly making our lives more enjoyable. Drawbacks that were mentioned above, can be dealt with if an effort is made by an individual.'",

Other people think it is important to keep working life completely separate from social life. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Proponents believe that being extra-friendly with co-workers in our free time is a beneficial idea whereas opponents argue that we should completely differentiate our office relations and our social relations. In my view of thinking, interacting socially with work colleagues is good for making a workplace a happy place. However, sometimes being over-friendly with fellow staff creates some ethical issues with the disciplinary guidelines of the organisation.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, making some good friends makes our lives easy in many aspects. Specifically, at offices, where many individuals spend their duty hours of the day, we need a stress-free environment. Therefore, it is a good step to socialise with our subordinates during possible hours like evenings or weekends. Good tuning between the job team is always beneficial for the outcome they produce, A TV9 survey in March 2023, for instance, proved that the social interaction between officemates is useful for boosting  the quality of tasks they do together.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some issues related to mingling with company colleagues have been reported at many organisations. To be more specific, over-friendly relations between officemates may cause the likelihood of favouring someone all the time regardless of his/her capabilities over other hard-working fellow staff. Moreover, few employees may pressure their managers for benefits such as salary hikes, promotions or ease of  duty. Hence, it is said that work-life must not get mixed up with our regular life. For example, in my first company, a senior manager was fired from his position on account of favouring his friend for onsite opportunities.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, admittedly, an office place should be a happening place to produce more and more quality outcomes and this can be achieved through bonding well with colleagues regularly. Still, there are some risks associated with it if not kept within limits.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Lacking  money is an issue for some, which leads to the opinion that the sole purpose behind working diligently is to earn more money. I totally disagree with this notion and will give my rationale in this discussion. \r\n\r\nHaving financial issues could decrease the quality of life, which contributes to someone working harder than others to fulfil their basic needs. Take the financial recession in 2008 as an example, many people lost their jobs and their homes which consequently made people work harder and make more money to sustain their normal needs. Or if a member of a middle-class family was diagnosed with a terminal health problem, in order to pay for the long-term treatment, someone in the family potentially needs to double their time of work to earn more money. Therefore, some do have the need to devote more time and energy working to make extra cash, not with the sole purpose of making a lot of money but in order to cover their needs. \r\n\r\nAnother reason  why some focus on work more than others is because they have a mission. Take ultra-marathon runner and Ex-Navy SEAL David Goggins as an example, he was able to participate in the world's most challenging marathon to date and actually finished it with record timing. In order to achieve such a feat, he worked very diligently on himself and with his mission backing him up which was raising money. Moreover, the funding he received from the marathon was not for himself but for providing for the families of his fallen comrades in the Navy while on active duty. Thus, there are higher purposes to push someone to focus on their job, career or mission. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, earning more monetary possessions is not the only reason for a person to work harder but there are other purposes that motivate someone to do so.'",

To what extent do you\r\n\r\nagree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that we should knock down old buildings and build modern ones because too much money has been spent looking after and repairing them. Although it is true that one can spend a lot of money to restore and look after the old buildings, I strongly disagree that we should just destroy them and build a new one instead. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, we cannot deny that old buildings have a lot of memories that are really precious for their owners. For instance, my house is more than 50 years old and was built when my grandmother was still a kid. It contains the memories from three generations including me, my parents and my grandparents. Every room always reminds me of a certain memory, making me remember my root and who I am. This kind of feeling is so treasured and no amount of money is too expensive for this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, old buildings have a cultural value that can be used to showcase their history. For example, there are several old buildings in my country that are being restored and transformed into museums such as Fatahillah, a museum that was built when the Dutch ruled my country. Fatahillah Museum now become the main destination for students to learn about the history, culture and architectural aspects of when Indonesia was still ruled by the Dutch, a hundred years ago. This kind of experience is meaningful and will not happen if old buildings are destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do believe that old buildings have a special value. Repairing and looking after them is worth the price, hence we should not knock down the old building nor replace them with a modern one.'",

Although almost all people are fond of working for popular and big corporates, it is sensible that at the initial stages after graduation, graduates seek jobs at small-size companies.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some merits of small association for being employed are presented. As a small community, colleagues and superiors at small workplaces can dedicate more time to a new commer  owing to the flat structure of organizational charts or the few levels of hierarchies. Thus, this close relationship often enables students to learn more after graduation and be guided directly by top managers. Hence, the more skills and qualifications that those graduates gain, the more likely their advancement of career path will be. Moreover, rarely can we find a small business where employees do not face a wide range of experiences lacking the recruitment possibility for each problem which has occurred. Therefore, after working for such companies, individuals will get valuable and multi-fascinated knowledge which equips them for further success. \r\n\r\nHowever, popular companies provide considerable incentives and facilities for their staff so that it is more likely for them to advance professionally. Besides, funding for innovative suggestions is nothing new in large-scale sectors. In terms of mental and emotional aspects, being proud of accomplishing successful tasks in such an enterprise, gives a feeling of self-confidence to staff.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, nobody can claim that recruitment in a big size enterprise provides the path for rising through the rank in terms of financial support and being stable, but a graduated person who has worked for a small business and learned well enough and then applied for a bigger company is more suitable career road map so that this multi-discipline and knowledgeable person can advance more easily when applying for a bigger company following working a while for a smaller one.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some educators hold a belief that all children should learn to play a certain musical instrument. Despite the disadvantages associated with students' hectic schedules, I believe that this approach is a good way to discover young musical talents and provide healthy pastimes for youngsters.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is undoubtedly that students are likely to suffer more pressure when musical subjects are added to the educational program. This is because this approach adds more stress to the already burdensome volume of schoolwork. In fact, students nowadays are often subjected to a busy schedule with a mounting of homework and in-class assignments. Therefore, adding another subject to their curriculum can make it more difficult for children to study effectively. The situation even gets worse if a child feels frustrated and no longer excited about learning music. They must be better off using that effort and time to focus on something which they are really interested in.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is understandable that learning music is believed to be beneficial for youngsters. Firstly, geniuses' musical talent can be discovered at a young age and later developed into a professional career. Dang Thai Son, who learnt the piano from his mother at the age of 6 and became the most Vietnamese successful pianist is an excellent example. Secondly, in the eyes of adults, learning to play music is a positive hobby and potentially replaces computer games. These days, teenagers spend most of their time watching mind-numbing television programs and playing digital games. Studies show that spending too much time on video games can produce behavioural and mental changes, leading to a lack of other activities and poor academic performance. Meanwhile, playing music can improve students' verbal memory, spatial reasoning and literacy skills. The main reason is that playing music involves both sides of the brain which strengthens memorial skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while learning to play a musical instrument can bring certain benefits to young people in terms of the discovery of young musical talents and organizing healthy pastimes, it is important to acknowledge its drawbacks such as increased pressure. It is advisable that musical education should be provided to students who are really interested in and willing to pursue it rather than imposing it on all children.'",

Personally, I strongly agree with this statement because I ponder that various machines have affected the way in which individuals do shopping.\r\n\r\nFirstly, all humans, especially adults, have extensive working schedules, which means that the time to buy commodities, which are required, is extremely limited. Nevertheless, owing to modern technologies, it is possible to do everything on time because people do not have to dedicate minutes and hours in order to buy their desired products. For instance, in the past our ancestors could not make a purchase remotely, consequently, shopping was an essential procedure for them, however, now humans can easily order some goods, which will be delivered to their homes. Hence, with up-to-date technologies individuals are eligible to arrange their day properly for the reason that shopping is not time-consuming anymore.\r\n\r\nSecondly, while searching for a particular product on the Internet, consumers are able to analyze the market precisely and draw appropriate conclusions because all the websites can be compared. Simultaneously, purchases have become cheaper since consumers have an opportunity to determine whether there is a beneficial correlation between quality and price. For example, if a person finds an elegant dress, but, a factor concerning finances does not satisfy, one can easily switch to another site and find something suitable. Thus, advanced machines have created a so-called huge network, where everyone is able to highlight the best offers for them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that some individuals claim that technologies are not influencing the way of buying and selling goods, I would reckon that it has an enormous impact indeed. Consequently, online shopping has revolutionized the consumer experience, thereby, creating an outstanding replacement for ordinary strolls by the shops.'",

How can these problems be overcome?' \n 'Text': 'The imbalance of daily life has been exacerbated in the wider range of the population, while a few humans could achieve an ideal balanced life. This issue stems from the more competitive extent of the overspeed developing economy and this puzzle could be solved by the following remedy.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the cutthroat market and an unstoppable change in technology have put people into a specialized race to avoid layoffs. Initially, in the beginning stage of the fifth revolutionization, people could be replaced by automatic machines based on the Internet of Things, which led to a reduced workforce and an increased rival rate. In particular, many factories split their manufacturing procedures into a number of stages participating by almost mechanical devices and robotic arms, these producing chains not only enhance the quality of commodities with fewer errors and improve the finished product volume but also decrease the essential workforce. As a result, this model has significantly expanded because the capitalists could attain the surplus monetary amount from reduced labour for the same good volume. For example, many white collars have experienced a massive layoff as many repetitive tasks could use some specific artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve a balanced work-life condition, the public should spend time for themselves rather than working overtime in the workplace, which requires the government to find a way to reduce the unemployment rate. In simple terms, the crowds could be comfortable as they do not worry about some recent labour cutoff. Hence, this vexing conundrum could be tackled by cooperating among  politics, academic institutions and multinational corporations. Firstly, the government should encourage all universities  to catch up with the shift of technology, which helps them provide suitable punctual majors to meet future personnel demands and avoid unemployment conditions for some  replaced occupations. Secondly, the collaboration between theoretical facilitations and companies could solve the shortage high quality workforce in some aspects and avoid layoffs as technology has the ability to replace humans. For instance, updating and editing the better curriculum and syllabus along with cooperating with some potential firms to prepare the job opportunities for their learners. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, some employees' cutoff has generated job pressures for the crowds and stifled them from an ideal life.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the youth crime rate, causing widespread concern among the public. Under such circumstances, some contend that parents should be responsible or even punished for their children's actions. Personally, I hold a different perspective on this opinion and I believe that teenage lawbreakers should take all accountability for their offences.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the idea that parents should be responsible for youngsters' malpractices is grounded in certain valid points. The proponents of this perspective argue that parents can serve as role models in shaping their kids' characteristics and behaviour. In fact, young children are likely to unconsciously imitate their parent's words and actions through a set of internal and external interactions. Therefore, whether a child has a good personality and proper attitude mostly depends on the parent's background. For example, a statistical report from the Canadian National Crime Prevention Crime revealed that individuals from families with a lack of order and discipline were 1.5 times more at risk of committing criminal activities than those from structured households.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do believe that lawbreakers themselves, not their parents, should be punished to ensure a justice system that is based on fairness and criminal deterrence. Firstly, it is unfair for the community if offenders can escape legal punishment and continue their normal lives despite harming society. In fact, punishment is to let them understand the price of their actions and prevent potential crimes in the future. Furthermore, if parents take all responsibility for their children's misconduct, it can create misleading impacts on children. They might understand that whatever unlawful actions they commit, they will not be bothered. Secondly, threats of being punished may prevent the risk of other teenagers committing anti-social behaviour, thus making society a safer and more peaceful place.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although parents may play a part in their children's wrongdoings, they should not take a part or major responsibility for this. I firmly believe that all lawbreakers, regardless of how old they are, should be punished to ensure the fairness of the legal system and prevent the potential increase in the youth crime rate.'",

What do you think is more important \u2013 personality or skills?' \n 'Text': 'Due to the complexity of processes within some companies, they have to hire people with specific attitudes and capabilities. While professional skills are vital in order to produce quality products or services there are positions and activities which require some specific personal features. I will bring some seasons and compare both approaches in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt's true that people are hired at a particular position not only for their professional skills. Moreover, there are cases when employers have zero experience in this field. However, the ability to cooperate and integrate new approaches is as beneficial as being productive. For example, in the IT sphere,  management positions are mostly occupied by specialists from different fields. The main reason for this is the ability to comprehend and suggest solutions without  regard to the technical side of the process. In other words, the ability to behave and communicate with people of different worldviews and approaches is like a lubricant in mechanical parts that makes it easier and more productive.\r\n\r\nConsequently, comparing the significance of attitude and skills in work it is necessary to mention the role of a person in a company. For instance, there are no chances for someone without experience to be hired as a plane pilot. Meanwhile, a difficult personality is an obstacle even for a great master of his craft as others are facing difficulties that prevent the smoothness of the work process. Thus, we can deduce that both skill and personality are important for a healthy work atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, people are hired not only due to their level of knowledge but for particular traits required to improve and fulfil work.

For example, Ukraine sought assistance from the global political scene to alleviate its social and economic damage due to the Russian invasion. \r\n\r\nTo combat said issues, a preliminary comprehensive evaluation and negotiation process is essential to get to the root issues. Affluent nations should host exchange programs and form an international expert panel to help the recipients allocate funds effectively. Research teams can investigate a country's unique needs and conditions to provide consultations on national strategic planning. For instance, there have been many trade agreements to welcome foreign investments to boost manufacturing and create employment. Furthermore, granting study abroad scholarships encourages talented individuals to pursue high-quality education at prestigious institutions. Young people will eventually return home and become leaders who drive the progress of their country. All in all, an international effort is more necessary than sole financial assistance. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while providing money is undoubtedly valuable, developed countries must discern the specific needs of those they aim to support. I believe that the exchange of information, strategization, and expert involvement will transform short-term remedies into sustainable, long-term solutions to combat poverty.'",

        "input": "'Question': '31.Some people say that too much time and resource are spent on the protection of wild animals and birds. To what extend do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is of the opinion that the preservation of wildlife has accounted for too much time and resources. Personally, I hold a different perspective on this notion. In this essay, I will explain my justification in detail.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it has been observed that the budget allocated to the conservation of wild animals and birds is still limited. This is because governments believe that animal welfare is only a minor importance, and other social issues should be prioritized. Therefore, they are unwilling to spend more funds on the protection of wildlife, making it difficult for organizations that are actually trying to make a difference. For example, in Vietnam, we do not see any long-lasting bird conservation due to a lack of financial support from the government. There are non-governmental organizations that are currently raising funds to protect the existing birds.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that dedicating time and effort to preserve wildlife is not only essential but also a moral imperative. This is because wild animals and birds play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity. They are a part of complex ecosystems and their extinction or decline can disrupt these ecosystems and lead to a range of adverse effects. Furthermore, preserving biodiversity can be beneficial for both ecological stability and human well-being as it impacts food, clean water and climate regulation. Additionally, people should have a moral responsibility to protect and care for the natural world. Various species are facing threats due to human activities, including habitat destruction, poaching and pollution. Thus, it is our ethical duty to rectify the harm we have caused and ensure that future generations can appreciate the beauty and diversity of wildlife.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is important to allocate resources effectively, and efficiently, the investment in wildlife preservation can be justified by the multitude of benefits it brings to society, ecosystems and future generations. Rather than viewing it as an expenditure, we should consider it an investment in the planet's health and well-being of all living creatures, including ourselves.'",

Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'It is thought by certain groups that different kinds of vehicles will be replaced by driverless systems. Since various benefits have witnessed in this trend, I personally suggest that the advantages are outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, driverless techniques have some hidden concerns that might increase the number of accidents. To elaborate, since driverless skills were just being developed not long times ago, most of the models are severely unstable. With that said, it did not only not generate convenience in people\u2019s lives but also showed a detrimental impact on road safety. In addition, driverless technology might lead to mass unemployment. The obsolete automobiles brought massive costs to the transportation allied enterprises. Subsequently, company owners are more likely to choose driverless vehicles due to the fact that they can significantly curtail unnecessary personnel expenditures. Consequently, many private drivers will lose their careers in this process, resulting in serious unemployment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even though there are many visible drawbacks mentioned previously, it still can be outweighed by the following merits. To begin with, driverless skills can free the time that people spend  focusing on traffic conditions. This can undeniably foster productivity for certain people. To cite an example, drivers can deal with their documents or work-related chores in the auto-driving car, moreover, casually relax to recover from fatigue. Secondly, since this skill will become more advanced in the short term, it can concomitantly reduce vehicle crashes substantially. It has been proved that nearly 90% of incidents are caused by human error. With this fact, driverless technology might potentially address this problem to a certain extent after we possess  mature skills in the driverless car spectrum.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, since the driverless technique has just emerged in the contemporary world, we are still not professional enough to control all the unpredicted factors. Nevertheless, the prospect of driverless is already viable at this moment, hence, the advantages of driverless is undoubtedly outweigh the demerits.'",

I completely agree with this statement since technology not only can facilitate the medical environment but also benefit the agricultural sector in many terms.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, advanced science can undoubtedly strengthen the medical field by creating innovative techniques and intricate devices. To elaborate, the death rate used to be outrageously high before the 21st century when various medical machines and skills emerged. While experts and allied specialists begin to put heroic efforts into the medical spectrum nowadays, different forms of extraordinary medical devices have been invented, such as sophisticated machines for helping patients who were diagnosed with inspiratory diseases like tuberculosis, or certain techniques that aim at giving birth. As a result, either the death rate or fertility rate in society had made positive progress. Consequently maintaining a decent quality of our life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, innovative science can viably impact agriculture. To cite an example, many semi-arid areas have suffered from terrible drought. With superior irrigation systems created in the contemporary world, this sort of phenomenon can be addressed holistically, and concomitantly reinvigorating the economy. For example, several Middle Eastern countries have all suffering from this situation for a while, attributed to their defectively geographical condition. Since scientists introduced the irrigation system, they have  subsequently been able to provide food for themselves, moreover, export their products worldwide. This again proves that human-aimed technology witnessed good effects and plays an integral role in this modern world.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, since cutting-edge science and terrific technology can benefit people\u2019s lives in the medical field and agricultural range, I personally support and agree with the topic.'",

Furthermore, using social networks for introverts to connect with each other is a valuable tool that can help them in various ways. Additionally, individuals can learn about the latest news that is trending around the world. For example, there are numerous applications that assist individuals to link up with others who share common passions and offer various abilities required for modern living.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, excessive use of social media platforms can lead to wasting valuable time that could be used more effectively at work. Furthermore, it has become increasingly common for people to lead technologically advanced lives. As a result, cybercrime rates have significantly increased in the past few years.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'Instead of funding roads, governments should invest in railroads. I completely agree because this is a good decision for the public. In my, opinion there are two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly, railways can carry a large number of passengers. They are an environment-friendly means of transport. It is travel is much more comfortable which is preferred by the customer. There are no traffic jams that can be seen on the road, Moreover passengers do not waste any time. They can go to the office, school, and other places on time.

For example, New City has the most opportunities for jobs and businesses all over the world which reflects crowded streets and places like offices, shops and restaurants. That's why the government spend millions of money to upgrade and create new methods that are related to the road and train structure. Moreover, it attracts people living outside the city to drive their own cars  instead of taking a plane or taxi. Also, as long as roads and trains are increased the population will be controlled. \r\n\r\nSecond, it can give sport riders more chances to drive safely and enjoy their own luxury motor. furthermore, sometimes buying a new brand car is hard to afford so using the train will be much cheaper.

Although nowadays the majority of pupils have used the internet to learn and acquire the required information, libraries have their own importance in providing resources. I partially agree with the above notion and my reasons for the inclination are articulated in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, it is true that, the Internet is a treasure of data and info in all  fields and It has to have its own advantages. Firstly, any data on any subject can be attained in a fraction of a second  around the clock; while libraries work only for a few hours  a day. Secondly, it provides mobility, the material gets updated  every second and one can get updated records in a minimal time. Finally, they provide comfort in getting information without going to a particular place and it is a boon to  busy people.For instance, students can also acquire details of the ongoing research on a specific topic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the libraries have their own importance. First of all, in terms of the ambience. Moreover, the libraries have a quiet environment with fewer distractions, which helps to study with full  concentration. For example, During examinations, 30% of students prefer to study in college or school libraries. Furthermore, anybody can update the blog or material on the internet and thus there are no granted research papers available to find records of the experiments. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, however the internet is a great source of information with accessibility and mobility, the library has its own advantages such as ambience, quiet environment and proof of correct data with the name of the author.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Some are of the opinion that homeschooling ought to be prohibited due to its disadvantages, whereas others believe that it has several advantages. In my opinion, I consider that homeschooling is a great educational method which can benefit both parents and students. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, according to some, family-led education can result in a number of pitfalls. One of the main reasons is that when children are homeschooled, they will lack  social skills. In other words, going to school gives students the opportunity to mix with other children which can undoubtedly help them to develop their communication skills. However, if children study at home, they will most likely be alone most of the time. This will clearly impact their personalities negatively. Another reason why some oppose the idea of homeschooling is that it can be costly. Although parents can teach their children at home, not all parents have the knowledge to teach all subjects to their children. As a result, they have to hire private tutors to teach their children. In this case, they have to spend a lot of money, and for those who have financial issues, this can definitely affect their budgets. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people claim that home-based learning can bring about a number of merits, and I agree. Firstly, this educational method helps students learn effectively. That is to say, parents or tutors can slow the lesson based on their children' or students' performance. For instance, if students are weak in science, a teacher can slow down the lesson to ensure that they master the lesson effectively. Nevertheless, in a normal class, this cannot be done because a teacher has to follow the curriculum of the school. Secondly, with this educational option, parents can monitor their children's behaviour. These days, many children behave badly because they are affected by their peers. When children are at home with their parents, they can monitor them most of the time, and therefore, they will behave well. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that homeschooling should not be banned owing to its positive aspects. If homeschooled were promoted, children would not only perform well academically but  also would have great personalities.'",

Initially, many people are so keen on shopping or taking holidays as a result  they desire to allocate checks for the purpose of their demand and there is certainly some truth in this. Withnotstanding poor activity of inhabitants, mostly they expend checks instead of saving,  in order to their family live temporarily  relax because  they once come to activity.

In my view, this trend should be perceived as a negative trend. In this essay, I will propose some strategies to make valuable advertisements and some reasons for their bad influence.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in this modern era, artists play an important role in business. They introduce products and increase the sales of the product easily. It will be beneficial for companies to hire artists in order to advertise their products. It will attract many people to buy the product. For instance, body lotions are sold within 15 minutes after the artists use the product on their skins. As a result, the companies gain more profit. The next strategy is to make an advertisement on online media. Many people now have social media both in urban areas and rural areas. They tend to spend more than 4 hours accessing social platforms. By advertising on social media, many people can get information about the products. Consequently, the products become well-known among the society.\r\n\r\nHowever, this trend can have bad effects on society. The main effect is people are becoming wasteful. By having the artists in advertisements, youngsters can be influenced to buy the products easily even though they do not need the products. They believe that having the same common goods with artists will make them look cool among their friends. This attitude will lead them to become impulsive buyers. The following effect is dressing unsuitable for their ages. Many people are influenced by the way their idols dress. The advertisements that show up on social platforms can make people dress unsuitable for their ages. They want to imitate their idols in online advertisements. For illustration, students dress sexy because they want to look like their idols. It will be harmful to the students as it can put them in dangerous situations such as sexual violence or being kidnapped by strangers.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this essay examines the way of making valuable advertisements and the potential drawbacks of their influence.

This essay will provide my own opinion with relevant examples leading to the second community. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many reasons to criticize young age students who are working. Nonetheless, by this, learners can get job experience sooner, than their peers. For example, employers always ask future employees about their job experience, even if the participant has graduated from university, giving their preference to the person who has experience and high results. In addition, bosses ask for work knowledge for at least 3 or 5 years, for that reason many young teenagers work from their childhood. Furthermore, scholars have the opportunity to get high-paying jobs sooner than others and get high demand from big companies that are searching for professionals with high basic knowledge. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, children are becoming more disciplined and are able to take more responsibilities for themselves. Consequently, the person will become more independent and will have more confidence in the job atmosphere in the future. For instance, current research made by the National American University of Psychology showed that young age attendees appreciate and divide finances more correctly, as a result, having  greater chances to achieve financial success. Moreover, many families have  financial problems situations, where children are forced to work and provide vital things to the house, especially in  third-world countries or disadvantaged households. \r\n\r\nIn summary, working at a young age provides many advantages in adulthood, it is definitely worth it, even if seems hard and \u201cbad\u201d for youngsters.'",

It gives them more job opportunities and a higher chance of finding suitable work.For instance, with the advances in technology, a noticeable number of works require computer skills which forces students to learn them through their study.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some individuals' concern is that student's performance in their main major might be bred by the minor course. It can result in a lack of skills in the main major and a huge loss in the future as well. Moreover, the minor subject may be completely irrelevant in their future and all the efforts they put in might be time-wasting for them. For example, today, learning fundamentals of AI is meaningfully popular among students because of the huge advertisement however, most of them will not use it in the future and they just miss their chance to improve themselves in relevant required skills in their job.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is argued among people whether studying a minor subject in university is an effective plan or not.

How to change their views\uff1f' \n 'Text': 'The tendency of global tourism has created the concern of its negative impacts on a nation by the locals. This essay will discuss the potential causes of this problem before suggesting recommendations that can be made to change this negative attitude towards international travellers.\r\n\r\nA number of perspectives indicate that foreign visitors are disadvantageous to their nation for some following factors. Firstly, the increase in the amount of tourists results in the increase of local waste. To illustrate, most travellers do not clean their trash after enjoying their time at the beach despite all locals' efforts to dispose of waste effectively. This can result in water, air and soil contamination. Another reason is the disrespectful behaviour of visitors to the local culture, such as mocking traditional customs. This can foster anger and conflict with communities, leading to fewer places being willing to support the country's tourism. \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem can be solved by active approaches. The city's governance can consider installing more trash bins and garbage collection in tourist attractions, for example, waterfall landscapes. Additionally, clearly publicized penalties for those inclined to litter can enhance locals' attempts to protect their habitat as well  the revenue from fines can fund the nation's tourism development. Furthermore, tour guides need to inform visitors properly about the local culture, for instance, wearing a short skirt when visiting a pagoda is inappropriate. From that travellers can acknowledge the differences in culture and show respect. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the concerns about the negative influences of international visitors are caused due to the tourists'  irresponsibility and disrespectful behaviour toward a region and its traditions. However, the problem can be eased by the support from the government and the local community.'",

Hence, what can be said is that not only could toxic gases exacerbate a plethora of environmental affairs, but also it could have a catastrophic influence on crops.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, pollution, which imposes a burden on the government economy, may aggravate a myriad of health concerns. To explain, when the rate of pollution rises, this could result in a widespread of malignant diseases. For instance, in Egypt, the authority allocates a high proportion of its budget to mitigate the effects of contamination on people's well-being. Hence, without focusing on environmental and pollution points, future generations would suffer in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the points mentioned above, it can be reiterated that even though there are a variety of issues, states put environmental problems as a main concern. I am convinced that in order to counteract these fatal environmental challenges, there would be local and global awareness.'",

Some contend that these games should be prohibited due to safety issues, whereas others believe that people should be free to do any sports activity. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, proponents of prohibition argue that dangerous sports bring numerous risks to players. To be more specific, they are dealing with life-threatening perils when playing these games, especially those involving specialized equipment such as skydiving, motor racing and jump base. It is true that no matter how talented they are, there is still the risk that the accompanying equipment is in trouble, causing serious injuries and even death to players. Additionally, some dangerous sports, like boxing, contain violent content which can lead to aggressive thoughts and behaviour of audiences, especially among teenagers. This is the main factor contributing to bully and criminal activities in school-aged children.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, proponents of dangerous sports argue that people should have the right to participate in any sports activity they like. An individual's freedom is first and foremost, thus, prohibiting someone from pursuing their passions is unreasonable, especially when they have fully acknowledged the risk that might occur. Furthermore, all players need to undergo a careful and rigorous training course when they play extreme sports. For example, people who skydive are required to obtain a USPA \\'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'People are disputing whether aqua or oil and gold are the most prominent natural resources in the World. While fossil fuel and precious metals are widely used in various industries and trading purposes  water is vital not only for the human population but for all living too. In the following paragraphs, I will expand on both approaches and bring a couple of examples.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the benefits of natural resources, humanity implemented them in many aspects of their lives. Our modern society, focused on consumption, completely depends on resources and constantly rising demand for new goods and services increases the value of these resources. However, this is an artificial lifestyle that will be tremendously changed due to the rapid progress of technology. In other words, with time passed more and more fuel and metals are going to be replaced with other sources of power and material.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no adequate replacement of H2O that is suitable for drinking. Water is represented in limited volume on our planet. Moreover, we can't anticipate and rely on instant changes in human biology that will make us less water-dependable. Based on this forecast it becomes obvious that water is the most precious natural resource for inhabitants of the planet Earth. Additionally, all plants and animals that resemble the contemporary food chain are water consumers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while there are divided opinions regarding the importance of natural resources, water is particularly significant. Taking into consideration other species and ingredients required for basic life we can declare that other fossils are secondary in the scale of life dependancy.'",

What can be done to increase this popularity?' \n 'Text': 'In comparison with other forms of transport, cycling would be an environmentally friendly approach. There are a a variety of reasons behind the lack of publicity and some steps, which can be considered to improve that.\r\n\r\nsome reasons can be discussed for the lack of cycling universality. Firstly, numerous individuals work far from their homes, such as factories in rural areas. They have to use their own private vehicles to reach their workplace, so they cannot use bicycles. Secondly, in developing countries, the infrastructure for bicycle manufacturing companies is at a low level. In these areas,  international firms dominate the cycling market, which is not cost-effective for both the government and citizens. Finally, some individuals are not completely aware of the numerous positive effects, which this kind of transport can in the environment. For instance, they do not know that cycling can reduce carbon emissions, which is the main cause of global warming and greenhouse gasses.\r\n\r\nSome actions can be taken in order to increase the commonness of cycling among people. To start with,  public transportation should be expanded into the countryside and some places should be built for hiring bicycles, especially in the city centre and residential areas. In order to do that, some employees would be encouraged to have some physical activities and hire a bike to the nearest underground station. Furthermore, advertisement can be an effective approach. Broadcasting on television, street billboards social media advertisements can aware individuals of the beneficial impacts of cycling.  Additionally, The governments should allocate funding to manufacturing companies to construct the majority number of bicycles. If the government support the cycling industry, the cost of this transportation vehicle would be reduced.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, cycling is not popular among individuals because of some reasons such as long distances and not awareness. However, some decisions can be taken to increase public knowledge such as government funding and advertisement.'",

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, the number of adults living with their parents is on the increase in some regions, even if they hold a degree or find a job. There are some upsides and downsides, but in my ,opinion the benefits of this type of living outweigh its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThere are some positive points for grown people who prefer staying with their parents, in spite of having a career or a graduation certificate in some countries. Firstly, the costs of living decrease dramatically. for example, it could be seen that one of the major problems of alone people is the mortgage of the house and taxes which could be easily solved by sharing these expenses with their families. Secondly, as they are living with their mothers and fathers, it is less probable to suffer from depression which we can see among those who have a solitary lifestyle, and If they encounter an emotional problem, they will be supported by them. They know that there is always someone who they can talk to or share their feeling with. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it could be seen that living with parents has some negative points. Lack of independence is likely the biggest issue of Individuals who choose this type of livelihood. Contrary to alone people, they could not feel a sense of freedom. For instance, if they want to go out, they should inform others or if they want to hold a party, they have to get permission or coordinate with their families. in fact, these subjects convey that they apparently, have no authority over their own life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Although people who are living with their parents may suffer from  dependency which is some kind of limitation for them, they could benefit not only from prorating the costs but also from being safe emotionally. So I believe the pros outweigh the cons.'",

Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view for a variety of reasons. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, income tax is an important source to build a nation. This is because tax is the money that working people pay the government for  public services such as health, education, and transportation. In fact, the government uses the tax amount and provides their citizens with all basic facilities to lead a good life. For example, the authorities of India allocate about 6% of GDP for different development and welfare programs. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, tax is a fund to secure the country\u2019s borders. This means that the government uses this source of money to pay salaries for working people in the military and equip weapons for the soldiers. In fact, in the modern period like nowadays, although war is not a big problem, it is believed that a country which has a strong military will be one of powerful nations in the world. For example, according to  Youth in 2021, the United States spent 801 billion U.S. dollars on its military, making it the country with the highest military in the world. Whist, China came to second position, having spent 293 billion U.S. dollars on their military. They both are the most powerful countries due to their strong armies. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, paying taxes is a necessary duty of each member of the community. In my opinion, the employee should not deny paying taxes because of their essential benefits in life.'",

Some people believe this growing trend has a detrimental impact on face-to-face communication, whereas I believe contracting via these tools has significant benefits.\r\n\r\nThe usage of cutting-edge communicational technologies in recent decades has improved significantly. Some individuals claim that while we are using them, we will lose our sense of having in-person speaking. They say that this is because people feel that if we spend with others online, this would be enough for them. In contrast, this will make them more socially isolated in society. Additionally, people will considerably less engage in effective communication activities outdoors in communities, while they can talk and share their ideas online. Consequently, they argue, this will definitely die out the sense of belonging in human beings.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe these arguments cannot hinder us from using the advantages of social media. The reason is that many individuals are living far from their loved ones. Therefore, the only chance for them to see their family and friends is through social media. For instance, thanks to significant developments in media, an abroad student who lives in Canada can see his or her parents online with the help of apps like Facebook, Skype, or WhatsApp. This will result in a decrease in the level of worry and anxiety between humans. Moreover, there are many online community-based forms in many apps such as Reddit or Twitter which helps folks to share their personal experience to help others. This will not only promote a sensibility of morality between us but also effects dramatically on our sympathy.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Although some individuals advocate that social media is harming our in-personal contact, I believe there are substantial advantages like fostering a sense of sympathy and morality between humans and reducing some bad feelings in our communications which can surpass the downsides of this development.'",

Do the disadvantages outweigh the advantages?' \n 'Text': 'Nature is one of the places that attract many tourists around the world. Although they are often doing inappropriate things towards  nature, I believe that they contribute a lot to the locals' economy.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the main drawback of visitors to states is they have a lack of awareness and respect for the host countries. To begin with,  irresponsible travellers tend to show their lack of awareness and empathy towards  nature, such as smoking in forests which can cause wildfire, and throwing their food waste anywhere. People could easily meet this evidence in famous places, and most of them already took serious action and warning towards those visitors. Besides this,  international travellers show an inappropriate attitude that breaks the rules, as the travellers do not really care to understand and do some research about the host countries' culture and laws. Consequently, specific communities are not really excited about international visitors coming to their land. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the brighter side of this phenomenon is tourists hugely contribute to the region's income. The foremost one is small businesses near tourist attractions always crowded by consumers as they will buy  souvenirs. In fact, they would make huge purchases for people in their home states, this  also could make the host countries become popular overseas. Secondly, despite the small businesses which sell products, local restaurants also gain huge profits from them. For example, Indonesia is very famous for its cuisine and when international people come, it is a mandatory activity to try foods here. Therefore, purchasing power from visitors overseas is  huge, which can thus make the locals acquire financial benefits.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while tourists could harm the environment as they  lack  knowledge and empathy, they will paramountly contribute to the national income of the host land. However, I am firmly convinced that the demerits are eclipsed by the merits.'",

To what extend to you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?' \n 'Text': 'It is crucial for juveniles to understand the differences between right and wrong when they are very young. Punishing is an important way to help them find out more about the distinctions. I completely agree with this statement and believe that some punishments are necessary during upbringing.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to differentiate bad and good traits for children when they are still very young because the early stages of life are the era during which one\u2019s personality forms and it is the best age to familiarize the young generation with humans\u2019 intrinsic values and morals. Furthermore, when the child is very young he or she is more likely to pick up good and bad behaviors from others and follow them. In this case, mothers and fathers should try and explain moral principles in an easy and convincing way and if the child does not accept his or her impolite behaviour, parents have to take more serious actions such as grounding the child to teach him or her a lesson. I believe that imposing moderate punishments definitely plays an important role in raising children.\r\n\r\nAlthough corporal punishments are not recommended, parents and teachers should be allowed to use other methods such as grounding them or giving them time outs because extolling them when they do something right in order to promote that trait is not always useful and can spoil them over  time. On the other hand, punishing does not always have to be cruel. For instance, it is amazing how using inspiring stories and poems that are based on promoting ethics can be helpful in instilling good values in children and informing them indirectly that they have misbehaved. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree that teaching the young manners and good deeds as well as including more strictness such as grounding is very important in bringing up.'",

Some argue that peer pressure is important while others feel it has distinct disadvantages.\r\n\r\nDo the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?' \n 'Text': 'Peer pressure refers to the influence young people experience within the same age group, affecting their behaviours. In my opinion, cohorts do have more positive impact than negative on adolescents and young adults. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, peer pressure often leads the young to engage in risky behaviours. For instance, teenagers may feel compelled to experiment with drugs due to the effect of their peers who engage in such activities. The desire to fit in and be accepted can override their better judgment, exposing them to serious short-term health risks and potential addiction later in life. Moreover, succumbing to negative peer pressure can adversely affect academic performance, as students may prioritize social acceptance over their studies. This desire for approval can result in poor grades, limited educational opportunities, and long-term negative consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, positive peer pressure can inspire adolescents to set higher goals, adopt healthier habits, and strive for academic excellence. Many teenagers are pressured by their peers to join a study group, leading to improved learning outcomes and academic success. Relatedly, supportive friends can inspire young adults to engage in physical fitness activities or pursue positive hobbies and talents, promoting a healthier and more well-rounded lifestyle. This sense of camaraderie and mutual encouragement fostered within positive groups can contribute significantly to personal growth and self-confidence. Actively seeking out positive and active cohorts and engaging in activities aligned with one\u2019s personal values can help mitigate the adverse effects of negative peer pressure while harnessing the advantages of positive influence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although peers can encourage risky behaviours and hinder personal growth, the motivational and emotional advantages make this pressure a positive phenomenon on the whole. Ultimately, striking some degree of balance between independence and positive peer interactions is crucial to minimizing the disadvantages and embracing the benefits.'",

It is good to facilitate the people and consider their health as the first priority but doing so may also lead many governments to face financial crises. I will discuss all these in my essay below.\r\n\r\nFirstly, many countries have a rule to pay for their health if they get ill. It is good if they are contributing to their health because some of the countries are not in good financial conditions so along with health they also have to look upon other sectors also like education, agriculture and many more. If they pay some amounts and reduce the burden benefits both citizens and the country. They will be safe from many other problems as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many argue that it is the responsibility of the government to provide them with the best healthcare services. Their point of view is also right because it is un unaffordable for many individuals to pay the full amount they even have money to eat. So, how it is possible for them to pay for the treatment? They are right but they do not know about the other's needs which their government is providing them like other necessities like gas, and water if they also start paying for this people become lazy and fully depend on the government for their work. Therefore, it is not a matter of a single sector it must be happening in a group or teamwork.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it is good if the government is paying for health if people are paying for themselves it is not harmful. It is a combined effort from both the individuals and the ministry to improve the status of their country by providing them with the best of all.

A number of folk loves to give their short period to the public who required it such as giving lectures, building houses etc. I believe there are several particular reasons like providing aid to them and the following paragraphs will expatiate both stances with lucid examples. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, the first and foremost reason of doing unpaid job is their symphatetic nature towards other. This means they have the soft skills who loves to perform the free activities to help others. For example: the population of developed nations always helps the developing countries to make houses to live under shelter in different weathers,especially in cold season. Apart from that, this is one of the best way to gain practice in their fields. To illustrate my point: in this competative world, it is next to impossible to get good job, thus, lots of individuals gain participation through volunteer jobs like community service worker etc.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, both youngters and poorer countries have benefits in this type of opportunities. The significant example of this is collecting a contact in their own fileds is not helpful for only society but for young people too as they are using their knowledge into practice. To exemplify: a fresher nurse who works without money is not only performing duties but also using theortical information into pratical which ultimately helps them to clarify their doubts. Moreover, if they want to take higher studies, this is good opportunity for them because they are in-touch with studies or work as well as they are learning everday from experienced people.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there is not doubt  that hiring a candidates without money is efficient for the counties because they aid them in various scenario such as building homes for population who needs, beside, it is even more helpful for newcomers as they can gain experience and learn from these opportunities etc.'",

Therefore, develop countries should give other types of help to poorer countries rather than financial aid. To what extend do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Wealthier nations are in great efforts to support poorer ones in solving famine by providing them with financial support. However, it is of the opinion that this type of help does not work, therefore, more effective alternatives are required. Personally, I am inclined to agree with this notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that financial aid can provide immediate relief in times of crisis, like natural disasters and health emergencies. It can help save lives and mitigate suffering. For example, locking down during the COVID-19 pandemic has exhausted the global economy, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries. Thus, money received from rich nations can help citizens from poorer ones meet basic needs such as clothes, food, medicine and accommodation. Additionally, in some cases, monetary assistance can help poorer countries develop basic infrastructure, including building roads, hospitals and schools, contributing to long-term development.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that poorer nations should be provided with other effective types of support to address the complex issue of poverty. Firstly, it is essential to have a quality education which is considered a sustainable pathway to economic development. A quality education can equip individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge that can improve their lives and contribute to their communities. When children access education, they can break down the cycle of poverty by securing their job opportunities and making informed decisions about health and well-being. It is expected by the United Nations that the GDP of poor regions may increase by 70% if all children can access education. Secondly, rich nations can transfer modern technology to poorer ones as a form of support. It is true that the adoption of advanced machines in the farming sector can boost agricultural productivity. This in turn can help them not only secure domestic food safety but also promote exporting, leading to an increase in overall income. To illustrate, a statistical report from the World Bank revealed that thanks to modern technology applied in the agricultural sector, the crop yields of Southern Asia have increased by 6 times during the last 40 years, contributing to the significant reduction of poverty in this area.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although financial aid can solve the problem of poverty to some extent, I firmly assert that providing poorer nations with quality education and modern technology is a more sustainable solution, helping these countries overcome impoverishment in the long term.'",

I believe everybody would agree that we are living in a technologically advanced world where every nation is spending a lot on  cutting-edge innovations and therefore, it is safe to say that these advances have now become an important part of our lives. Moreover, with the advent of computers, it did not take computer scientists a long time to create the Internet which almost everybody has access to nowadays. Furthermore, we were introduced to artificial intelligence which has revolutionized our lives.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the internet has been remembered as one of the greatest inventions of our time alongside  electricity and automobiles. It was not long after the first commercial personal computers were introduced that connecting multiple computers in the shape of a network went under extensive research in the greatest labs across the world. Soon after the network changed every aspect of our lives whether it was banking transactions, transportation, research or entertainment. For instance, my grandmother has joint pain and she cannot do her grocery shopping herself but today, she just uses an app called Snapp to buy whatever she wants and has them delivered to her doors. Thus, the internet is a great example of how our lives now depend on  state-of-the-art technology.\r\n\r\nSecondly, one of the most exciting advances of  recent times is artificial intelligence. It was no one but the first computer scientist, Allan Turing, who started the idea of intelligent computers. Since then,  although a lot of sci-fi movies suggested that we are going to be wiped out by the hands of the mighty robots, they have been helping  humanity a lot. It has been incorporated into almost every computer-based service we use whether it is online or even offline, such as our best search engines and the recommender systems in our most favourite e-commerce websites. For example, thanks to the navigation applications that we have available on our phones, we cannot get lost in the megapolises we live in. Hence, our massive use of machine learning algorithms leaves us with no doubt that  artificial intelligence has changed the entirety of our lives.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is not an easy task to write about the importance of  recent technologies because there are so many of them. But, as I mentioned earlier, the internet and following that  machine learning are now at the core end of every task we do on a daily basis and so, these technologies are great examples to implicate the role of innovations in our lives.'",

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages? \r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\r\n\r\nYou should write at least 250 words' \n 'Text': 'Social media has now proven to be one of the biggest parts of our lives. Some regard it as an indispensable tool, while others feel concerned about its impact on our social lives. This essay will delve into the positive and negative sides of social applications, as well as provide examples and arguments on why I personally believe that the disadvantages overshadow the benefits of the indicated development.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, websites like Twitter have proven to aid in connecting individuals all over the globe, enhancing their wealth of knowledge. In other words, with social networks, the public is more aware of the cultures and experiences that they otherwise would never  be in the know of. For example, there has been a trend named #BlackLivesMatter, which sheds light on the discrimination that coloured people experience in Western countries. Without social media platforms, many would stay ignorant of the racism that runs rampant in these countries.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, social websites could also bring irreversible damage to a person's mental health. One of these occurrences is that the Web serves as a coping mechanism for many to use, which discourages them from enduring the hardships of life. To exemplify, Hikikomori is a Japanese term for the crowd who are Internet addicts, staying in their rooms to escape the outside world. Moreover, mass media is not safe. Simply speaking, they create breeding grounds for the community with nefarious intents. A small portion of these instances would be the many accounts of not only information stealing, but also grooming, paedophilia and cyberbullying.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the World Wide Web is a useful tool to help the public connect, I believe that its influence is predominantly negative. This can be understood through the fact that these websites are extremely addictive and incredibly dangerous as well. Therefore, social network site consumption should be limited in our lives.'",

In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree with this idea as it is essential to support each other.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that what couples need is a sense of satisfaction in their relationship and since they have each other's support they are more likely to have a better life. Not only do they love each other more but also they learn to take care of their interaction. Moreover, they find it simplified to talk about their daily staff as they consider a time for chatting which results in augmenting their relationship. For example, if a man lies in front of the TV and the woman has to do all the household tasks at the end of the night, that woman will be exhausted and the man will be ready for sleep. Therefore, dividing household chores plays a vital role in the relationship of two people who are working full time.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, some people claim that cleaning the house and related staff are the women's duties. They insist that their wives can stay at home and not work outside the house. However, I do not find this argument convincing as if spouses strive for their purposes, they will be more likely to achieve their aims in a shorter time. Doing household tasks has nothing to do with  gender as in this contemporary era, women and men are equal and they have the same rights. Consequently, people should change their attitude towards sharing household chores since they seek to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree that sharing house tasks is logical between spouses who are working full time because it is a decisive factor in reinforcing their relationship. Also, they will be in the right direction in gaining their purposes as they have each other's support.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Due to the development of modernisation, governments allow real estate companies to build more skyscrapers in the city area. Some individuals argue that this condition creates loneliness and displeasure for certain groups of folks. I agree with someone who opines that the construction of tall building apartments has its own benefits for society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is true that apartments in tower buildings have several good points. First, living in  high-rise apartments gives people some daily-life convenience. Normally, apartment constructions are located in the centre of the city, where residents can easily reach various routes of public transportation, shopping centres and hospitals. Second, tall-building flats can attract youngsters and new immigrants from other places to settle down in the cities. The price of buying a flat is much more affordable than purchasing a house, especially for these new residents. Third, the existence of apartments in the tower buildings can help boost the rate of employment. The rental of apartments is cheaper than commercial real-estate properties and then it gives an opportunity for people to start small businesses such as hair salons, nail beauty offices and tattoo studios. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in my view of point, a human living in the sky structure suffers loneliness and displeasure. The main reason that condo residents feel lonely is that there is no community activity organised by property companies. Therefore, people do not have any connections with their neighbours, and they are not able to obtain instant support when they face small life issues. In addition, people who live in tall buildings are not happy due to the unhealthy living environment. Since most of the tower buildings are based in downtown areas, there are fewer greeneries and more air and noise pollution, as a result, human beings in the tall property cannot breathe fresh air and take a good rest. Furthermore, due to long-term loneliness and unenjoyment, it will eventually cause problems to human well-being including anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the development of high-rise apartment blocks brings benefits to human beings, however, I believe people can enjoy their life more and be healthier when living in a non-crowded community.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some individuals argue that the most effective method to enhance road safety is to have drivers tested each term. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the given statement, and I will elaborate on it in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, today, our automobile industries have developed; everyone can buy an auto, but we must pass the driver's licence test thus, the many cars on the roads also, accident rates are increasing. For example, in South Korea, the majority of aged communities still drive cars on the street but their cognitive skills are falling down as well as reflexes so it is a serious problem in society. Some old folks forget the pedal position and accidentally push the wrong pedal; hence, some people die because of that. So, at least aged communities should take the test each year which will reduce traffic calamities.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, nowadays, most drivers are 20~50 years old so, they do not need to take the analysis  at each stage. However, some young individuals drink alcohol and drive a car, which causes big car accidents. For instance, in South Korea, many young communities have auto incidents especially when they are drunk thus, approximately 30% of innocent folks die on the road, which is a tragic situation. For this reason, young people also take tests every period, and if we find a drunken driving crime, we must cancel their driver's licence. This reduces automobile accidents, and our roads are much safer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with this topic. Because of the rising number of old people, car accidents are increasing conversely young folks also have some problems. So, we should modify our laws and take the test every year which leads to making our societies much safer.'",

Many argue that the advantage is mainly the reduction of toxins, but others argue that it also improves travel conditions. After thorough consideration of all relevant factors, I believe that cheaper public transit results in less contamination and fewer gridlocks. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, when viewed from the environmental perspective, it is evident that more affordable public shipment causes less contamination. Although the potentially negative impacts of more affordable public transportation must be taken into account, I still believe that public shipping has in many ways benefited us. For example, a prominent scientist once stated that people will travel more by public transport instead of private cars when public shipping becomes less expensive, and this reduces air pollution. It is thus clearly shown that one advantage of cheaper public transit is the reduction of air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn addition, another social factor should also be considered. As far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of public transportation is to make our lives more convenient. For instance, a recent article published in The Economist revealed that the problem of traffic jams can be significantly alleviated when people choose affordable public transport. Undoubtedly, this is a clear indication that another advantage of cheaper public shipment is fewer traffic jams.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, due to the reasons outlined above, I have a strong belief that the advantages of cheaper public transit are better air quality and eased congestion. In order to move things forward, all parties involved must make a concerted effort to communicate and start changing. With all our efforts, we can certainly make this world a much better place to live.'",

Do you agree?' \n 'Text': 'There is an opinion that primarily staff members, who have dedicated many years to working for a particular company, should be given executive positions in a company. I disagree with this viewpoint inasmuch as younger workers may have more skills and if not provided with an opportunity for a promotion, they will become demotivated. \r\n\r\nAlthough senior employees have proven to be more reliable and loyal, more often than not, it is novices who have a wider cluster of relevant skills. This is because young specialists exert their full effort in mastering their hard and soft skills in order to meet the requirements of today's highly competitive job market. Therefore, having been promoted, such workers may bring innovation and help to better incorporate the latest technological advances into business processes which is irreplaceable for every company to flourish. For example, the average age of a new hire at Facebook is only 23, for this very purpose. \r\n\r\nYet, another reason why less experienced staff members should have even chances for a promotion is that otherwise they will not be motivated to do their best. Knowing that however hard they try, they will not be given a higher position in a company, young employees will likely grow reluctant to go the extra mile, which may negatively affect a company's revenue and curb its development. To illustrate, a prominent entrepreneur Pavel Durov had to leave his first workplace since despite his outstanding abilities, he was not rewarded with a leading role. As a result, he has successfully set up his own business, while his employer lost his company due to a lack of highly qualified workers. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though individuals who have worked fewer years for a particular company might be less trustworthy, they should be equally promoted as they have up-to-date knowledge and skill sets. Besides that, this will encourage them to apply their abilities to the fullest, thus contributing to the company\u2019s prosperity.'",

Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The academic curriculum in the university requires it to be relevant to one\u2019s chosen field. It is the opinion of others that some schools should focus on learning other subjects together with the main ones while others oppose it. In this essay, I will discuss both standpoints and briefly state my side with regard to this proposition. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, going to school means a person\u2019s role is to learn and be knowledgeable. Being exposed to and involved not only in main subjects but also in other alternative topics may improve their mental, social and practical skills, which are important for work qualifications. For example, incorporating general psychology will definitely aid people to be emphatic and be trained to adapt to coworkers. Moreover, an introduction to stocks and tax will improve an individual\u2019s skill of saving and investing their money.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, attending the school\u2019s time and attention to preparing students for  qualification will support them in the bits and pieces of the work they will be choosing in the future. It gives them more opportunities to try and experience the real side of their job. Including lessons related to their occupation will prepare them for doing work tasks and taking their roles appropriately and accurately. For example, including numerous mathematical equations and logical analysis will help a student to be an engineer or be trained in hospitals if they would like to be a nurse or medical practitioner. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, it will have affectations on an individual\u2019s life. Personally speaking, I support the viewpoint of having minor courses to expand a person\u2019s knowledge and build more possibilities that may add to their experiences before entering the real world.'",

To what extent do you agree on disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is evidence to suggest  a dramatic shift in the relationship between human and animal species in the industrialized period, and now the purpose of animals in human life changed in comparison with previous times. I firmly agree with this statement and I will explain my stance in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, perhaps the major factor contributing to this phenomenon is the advanced accomplishment in human society. In particular, many useful devices were invented by scientists as more scientific breakthroughs were established, such as the usage of gasoline engines or jet engines, in diverse spheres. For example, nowadays, farmers can fertilise by using a controller drone and harvest food crops by driving an agrimotor with an internal combustion engine. While, before the industrialized moment, farmers used buffalos or horses for agricultural purposes. Additionally, people now can commute faster and further by the metro railway system, compared to going by horse-drawn carriage in the previous.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with high living standards, people pay more attention to their health and this results in a vegetarian phenomenon in the world leading to more citizens now feeling better after a period of a meat-free diet. In contrast, many people consider meat as an indispensable source in almost all meals, and they usually prefer eating wildlife animal meats in earlier times. Besides, many animal species are now protected by law, and hunting them is illegal. Lastly, but more importantly, a large number of species now have become domesticated and plenty of them have become human companions. Consequently, the emerging trend of fostering pets, such as dogs or cats, become popular in the human community, and the elite class usually loves owning a wildlife giant cat because this rare wildlife will express their social status and financial ability.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the purpose and the relationship of animals for humans changed drastically through the industrialized moment, as humans used machines rather than animals and moved to a vegetarian diet.'",

However, it is hard to deny that people are using it for various online negative activities. So, I agree with the given statement and I have ample points to prove my stand. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, one of the biggest issues that can be seen easily is that individuals like to spend their time chatting with friends online or watching movies, hence they have no time for family. Back in the day, families used to come together to spend some quality time, but nowadays, everybody likes to chat or video call on WhatsApp rather than meet offline. For example, a survey conducted by BBC shows that up to seventy per cent of youngster like to spend their time online, which is a matter of concern.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is hard to ignore when it comes to bullying and online stalking. People who spend most of their time on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are more likely to get stalked by online predators. Moving further, it also impacts their social life, as it becomes hard for them to make friends in school or at work. For instance,  a report submitted by Times Magazine shared that teenagers are the ones who get the worst out of it as it becomes hard for them when it comes to social networking.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I agree that people of all ages like to escape the real world, where they can forget about their stressful life, but spending too much time on the phone and especially chatting with random folks is not positive either.'",

Do you agree or disagree with this.' \n 'Text': 'In the modern era, society raises questions regarding spending capital. Some People believe that spending funds on old buildings should not be a focus, as authorities should be more concerned about constructing new roads and houses. In my view, I totally agree with this idea and support my essay with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the Government have to focus more on the development of the new buildings because they are doing it from people's taxes so it should be for their comfort. For example, In Pakistan, there are more requirements for making highways so that individuals easily go anywhere. In other words, it saves their time. Secondly, we realise more importance of developed roads when something happens to us. Like in emergencies, when the ambulance was not reached at a specific time and somebody died just because of undeveloped highways. Finally, I believe, a place that needs more homes for poor individuals and spending capital on the historical old building seems to be  a waste of funds.\r\n\r\non the other hand, it is a common fact that old building shows our old architecture and culture. For example, In India, there are a lot of forts, which should be maintained by authorities as they relate to our ancestors and we firmly believe in attachments. Moreover, it also encourages tourism because many tourists only come to see the oldest buildings. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I would conclude that where restoration of old things maintains our culture and attracts tourism. I personally believe the first government should spend their resources on society's welfare by making goods homes and motorways.'",

Support your point of view with reasons and/or examples from your own experience.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, it is becoming common for some countries to encourage older professional people to retrain as school teachers. However, I disagree that this scheme will bring positive impacts for two reasons.\r\n\r\nThe main reason is they do not have sufficient experience in handling pupils. Overqualified people tend to have jobs in international companies. It makes them interact more with adults. For instance, the managers' job description is related to discussing business with coworkers. By retraining old professional people to become school teachers, students can not be handled properly. As a result, the class can not be running well. Being a teacher requires experience that relates to students. Not every overqualified person can be a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe next reason why making the scheme for overqualified people teaching has a negative effect is they have different major backgrounds. The older professional people come from different majors. Moreover, they never learn about teaching youngsters in their latest major. It will make them face many difficulties, such as not being able to grab the pupils' attention. For illustration, an overqualified person can not use the proper teaching aids to teach about algebra. Consequently, students can not understand the material fully. It will affect the student's academic success. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, this essay examined the potential drawbacks of encouraging overqualified people to retrain as school teachers, which are difficult to handle youngsters and the possibility can not teach the students well.

Moreover, in the past, music used various things such as treatment, stopping war and assisting to make folks relax. In addition, nowadays, many communities listen to music, and they find solace in that. For example, In South Korea, there is a pop culture called K-pop and a famous singer named BTS who made songs from their experiences and encouraged others so that numerous world individuals listen to their songs and feel comfortable, which leads to peace and relaxation. For this reason, I believe that music has power in people's minds and some music is used for treatment. This phenomenon remains the shared expression of humanity because the majority of communities listen to BTS music, and they want to learn Korean so it is beneficial to South Koreans.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some countries use music to control their citizens because they make people loyal so that they dominate their nation permanently. For instance, In North Korea, they make music only for their dictator because if they make various music genres, that dictator will kill them. Furthermore, most of their citizens do not talk about opera or musicals because they have no freedom. Therefore, these kinds of nations do not share a language of humanity, which is a tragic situation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I partially agree with this topic.

So, we should try to assist those kinds of nations because we are global citizens, and they deserve to rights listen to various music.'",

There are many reasons behind this trend. There is nothing wrong if somebody wants to make some changes in a look, however going for risky surgeries is not worth it, as their life is always at risk. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, Nowadays, everybody wants to look like an actor or a model, and for this people make many changes in their overall appearance. Moreover, one of the main reasons is not feeling confident or some folks do not find themselves good-looking or beautiful and because of this, insecurities they get easily influenced by social media. They see posts of celebrities like Kylie, Kim, or Madison Beer who change their look with the help of plastic surgeons.

Many people prefer to live in a big city in order to get a well-paid job and a career. The tendency to move from rural areas to the cities has changed the infrastructure and caused some issues around road facilities. In my essay, I will talk about the solutions to improve the situation with  traffic conjunctions - to build a new road or a metro. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, any decision, which can be made towards resolving traffic jams on the road, will work out effectively. Firstly, to build a new metro will be enormously expensive for the government, but more sufficient for people. Moreover, an underground has some particular benefits such as a perfect system with the exact timetable. Saying that  dwellers can rely on the subway and never be late for work or an important meeting. Furthermore, the metro will reduce traffic on the roads, because fewer people will use cars. Consequently, the construction of the tube is  beneficial for the modern society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I mentioned above, building the underground costs  money. As an alternative, with less financial investment, the state can expand the road system which will help decrease the traffic conjunction. Although the idea of building more roads can be beneficial for drivers the fact that increasing number of cars will lead to  environmental pollution. Thus, the government must take into account the fact of increasing carbon emissions with the growth of cars.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, any plan to reduce traffic jams will definitely work for the general public.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, because of our technological development, pupils can easily access data on the Internet, so some people think that libraries will be unnecessary in the future. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the given statement, and I will elaborate on it in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, today, our technology is developed, so we live comfortably more than in the past, and many IT devices have been invented, which means learners do not need to buy textbooks; they can download them onto their IT devices and use them in their class. For example, in advanced nations, they are introduced to the majority of implements and use their class and teach their pupils. As a result, students do not go to libraries anymore because they can find data so easily and fast. In addition, In New Zealand, most schools tell their learners to bring IT gadgets, which leads to learning data as well as knowledge. Therefore, they think libraries are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if students encounter any difficulties and there is no adult around them, they can find details easily, and if they want some novels and fiction, they can buy those reports on the Internet and see them anywhere, which means they do not have to go to libraries. For instance, In South Korea, in Seoul, there were a lot of bookstores in past. At that time, numerous individuals had to purchase a book, even pupils but now most learners can see records on the Internet consequently, the majority of libraries disappeared. Hence, in the future, a few libraries stay the same and others will not.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with this topic. In the past, we did not have any digital things, but now we have invented IT technology, so plenty of folks do not want to go to libraries because most communities have their own IT devices. However, libraries are a crucial thing because, in libraries, there are many history bills written by ancestors. So, we must preserve them very carefully because those charges are part of our heritage.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Modern technology is now very common in most workplaces. How do you think has changed the way we worked? Do you think there are disadvantages to relying too much on technology?' \n 'Text': 'These days, it can be noted that most employers use modern inventions to run their businesses. In my opinion, by using the latest technology, companies can do their work effectively, but when they rely on it too much, it can lead to a number of problems.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, using modern technology will not only enhance employees\u2019 performance but also the company\u2019s income. In other words, companies that use AI programs are able to finish their tasks within a short time. This is because they can generate more ideas easily compared to traditional methods in the past where they had to have a long discussion. For instance, marketing companies can come up with effective marketing strategies and ideas which can clearly help companies to improve their sales. Thus, with this, employees will have an easy working environment, while companies will gain more profits.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage here by using modern technology restaurants and shops are able to give their services to customers when they are at home. Moreover, companies that had improved their system before covid 19 faced it perfectly. For example, Pizza Hut delivers their food for the consumer without any visiting needs, and that is just by one click in their own application. As a result, if restaurants and shops improved their service, they could earn high profits just by using the new technology.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the near future, people think companies will replace workers by relying on AI technologies, and that will cause many economic issues for citizens. Furthermore, if they lose their jobs, they will not cover their needs and expenses which leads to starvation. Because of that governments must control this development before damaging the future. To clarify my points in 2021 when Elon Musk had bought Twitter, he fired more than 65% of his employees because he could handle the whole of this International company without them by just relying on AI technology. Consequently, people around the world have experienced what Elon Musk did, and they have started to think cautiously about this development which can risk their careers. \r\n\r\n In conclusion, technologies are essential for growing companies' systems and services which are helpful for the customers to serve them without doing any little effort. However, it also has negative effects and may determine humanity's future.'",

While I acknowledge that there are some positive effects of this trend, I believe that the drawbacks of using gadgets at a young age outweigh their benefits.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many disadvantages to this phenomenon. In this modern era, offspring play online games for extended periods, consequently, adopting a sedentary lifestyle. Sitting for a long time in front of a computer or a laptop has a negative effect on their physical and mental development. Another drawback is that, due to the voice recognition and speech-to-text facilities, children are lacking in writing skills. These facilities enable spoken words to be automatically transcribed into written text on smartphones, tablets and various other electronic gadgets, In lieu of typing, youngsters prefer to use voice recognition for writing tasks. Hence, kids are becoming lazy too. It is common to observe that children often use electronic devices more for entertainment than for educational purposes. For example, in this contemporary society, there are many parents, who often complain that rather than using smartphones or tablets for education, their kids play online games or watch reels on social media.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many advantages to using mobile phones and digital pads at a young age. Firstly, these types of digital devices can make lessons much more interesting. Children show more interest when they get a chance to study on electronic gadgets. Furthermore, students can do research using online resources. Thus, they can save time by finding information online instead of searching in books. Students also learn skills which are useful for their future jobs. For example, they learn to write reports using a word processor.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while there are certain advantages to using mobile phones and digital pads for education and entertainment, the disadvantages outweigh them and cannot be ignored.'",

What can be learnt from this?' \n 'Text': 'While the level of happiness among citizens living in developing countries is rising, society in developed nations is reportedly becoming unhappier. This essay will elaborate on several reasons for this problem and suggest some lessons that can be learnt from this.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are two possible reasons attributed to this phenomenon. To begin with, due to  economic progress, citizens living in underdeveloped nations are more satisfied with their lives. This is because economic growth is associated with the improvement in various domains such as healthcare, infrastructure and so on. Hence, individuals' basic necessities can be fulfilled which contributes to a better living standard for people. In contrast, this is not the case for society living in developed countries where they have to cope with the pressure of trying to succeed. A fast-paced life requires people to work around the clock with the aim of achieving desired goals. Consequently, individuals may find it difficult to balance their work with other aspects of life. They are more prone to chronic stress and burnout, which affect adversely both mental and physical well-being.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are two lessons that can be learnt from this issue. Chief of these is that holistic development of the economy plays a vital role in creating a happier life. If society's life is stable with advanced technology and connectivity, they can live without any worries over how to make ends meet. Therefore, citizens' stress can be significantly alleviated; which helps increase the level of well-being. Furthermore,  balanced material progress with social connections and community engagement is also needed. By having a work-life balance, people are able to spend quality time with their family and friends in order to strengthen family bonds, which helps them enhance life satisfaction and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, economic development is a crucial reason leading to the happiness of less-developed countries, while the pressure of being successful triggers an unhappy life for those living in first-world nations. From this phenomenon, we can learn that both a comprehensively developed economy and work-life balance are of utmost importance factors to ensure people's well-being.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is true that family has an indispensable role to play in one's growing process. Therefore, some individuals harbour a belief that young people have to divert their free time from outside amusement to families. This essay will delve into both perspectives in a comprehensive manner before explicating my position.\r\n\r\nInitially, one of the main arguments in its favour is that the time with families will be gradually reduced when growing up. Many people spend less time at home as their life circles expand. For example, some students move to another city for college. The main period of staying with families in one's life is usually from birth to teenage years. Moreover, this is a period which relies on the function of family the most since children need parents to take care of them and teenagers require support and guidance when encountering obstacles or being lost.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, hanging out with friends for amusement is also  vital to one's early life. It can not only build up a social network but also elevate personal visions by meeting different kinds of individuals and even learning some skills like attending sports teams. In addition, the connection with peers is an essential aspect ,especially at young ages which may influence the development of mental health. Besides the aforementioned, outside entertainment indeed brings some positive effects. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, both viewpoints are compelling because the two factors are critical to constructing  optimal growth. Thus, youngsters should divvy up their free time evenly so as to strike a balance between family and friendship. The front and centre is to cherish the people around.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Improvements in technology that occurred in the distant past produced more positive effects than the developments that have occurred in the last few years. I completely agree with this statement and the following paragraphs shall outline the reasons for this belief.\r\n\r\nThe early telephone completely revolutionized the way business was done and benefited humanity greatly. For the first ,time people could send messages long distances with ease and the pace of business increased dramatically making more people richer and creating more job opportunities. However, these days when the latest iPhone update comes out the only real shift has to do with fashion rather than providing any real new benefits. For example, now you can upload items to a \u2018cloud\u2019, or play more advanced games, but neither of these advancements in any way compares to the early time phones were released to the public.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the above, the early computers also transformed the way companies ran their businesses. Previously there were filing cabinets full of paperwork and accessing that information could take hours to locate the piece of information that you wanted. In ,contrast though, computers have been around for so long now that they have almost reached their limit in terms of how useful they could possibly be. For example, the only real modification that happens now is new releases of the Windows operating system and the so-called growth is actually just considered an annoying transformation to many rather than actual progress.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the most profound long-lasting impacts that technology has brought us occurred many years ago.

To what extend do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Owing to the rampant growth of the population, a significant amount of environmental concerns can be seen all over the world. Despite using fossil fuels other alternative solutions should be considered. I completely agree with the given phenomenon, since the depletion and burning of exhaustible resources bring about many negative ramifications such as global warming and wild animal extinction.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, reckless consumption of fossil fuels may widen many issues. Firstly, global warming is the paramount concern of that. To be more precise, burning fossil fuels directly influences global warming. If global warming rises, it directs greenhouse effects. For example, recent research reveals that air pollution has risen drastically over the past decade. Hence, it is better to research other safe alternatives.\r\n\r\nSecondly, some wild animals are on the brink of extinction due to the burning of fossil fuels. Furthermore, burning fossil fuels may affect animal's habitats. Moreover, if global warming rises, the sea levels go up and affect fish and some other organisms. For instance,  a study which was done by the Ministry of Environment shows that approximately 40 wild animals and some types of fish have been on the brink of extinction over the last 5 years. Therefore, investigation of other resources is a need of the day. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, nowadays, it is believed that giving priority to the development of safe alternatives rather than fossil fuels is a crucial thing. I totally would argue with the given statement, since depletion of fossil fuels ushers global warming and wild animals' extinction. It is recommended that the government should impose stringent legislation to curb unwanted consumption of exhaustible resources and should subsidize the development of other alternatives.'",

What can be done about this problem?' \n 'Text': 'It is true that in today's modern world, widespread famine and food shortages still exist in many parts of the planet despite many breakthroughs in agricultural development. This essay will highlight several primary causes and suggest some measures that the government and anti-hunger organizations could take to combat this problem.\r\n\r\nOne of the major causes that contribute to food shortages is the climate change. Extreme weather events such as natural disasters or prolonged droughts in certain areas of the world prevent  food production. Consequently, crops exposed to these extreme events may all die out. Furthermore, wars are also another cause of world hunger. It is evident that for survival, thousands of people started to migrate to avoid guns and fire. Meanwhile, these refugees struggle in a new place and have difficulty making ends meet, and as a result, they can not afford to buy food.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are solutions to this problem and this requires the helping hand of the government and anti-hunger organisations. First of all, they should introduce new laws and stricter regulations in order to stop or inhibit violent attacks, social riots, conflicts and wars. Moreover, it is necessary to send experienced scientists and experts in the field of agriculture to regions frequently suffering from climate change, and install early warning systems for extreme weather to confront climate change.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, various approaches could be implemented to help fight world hunger driven by climate change as well as by wars and conflicts, which are taking place in many regions around the globe.'",

Hence, some argue that in the future, no one will buy printed materials because they will have free access to everything they want to read online. In my opinion, I partially agree that people will shift towards using online content more than traditional media, however, traditional printed books and newspapers have unique emotional and collectable values that the Internet cannot replace.\r\n\r\nFirst, The Internet offers enormous convenience, many people now prefer to access the latest news online, often for free, instead of buying hardcopy publications. This transformation is clearly shown in the decreasing circulation of traditional newspapers. For instance, news websites provide real-time updates, eliminating the need for daily hardcopy publications. In addition, many online platforms offer free access to e-books, making reading more affordable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, print media still holds its own sentimental and collectable value. These physical media provide sensory and emotional experiences that digital media cannot replicate. Moreover, some people are concerned about security when reading online because it can be more easily tracked and analyzed. For example, holding a well-bound book, feeling the texture of the pages, and the distinct smell of ink all contribute to a unique reading experience. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the digital age has transformed our reading habits and led to a decline in the purchase of physical publications, it would be too early to predict their complete extinction. Convenience and cost-effective online content are undeniable advantages, the sensory experience and emotional connection offered by print media ensure that conventional reading material will maintain a place in our future. Balancing tradition and innovation will be the key to the survival of these two forms of media in the years to come.'",

This essay will explain why I totally agree that reading is better than watching TV\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is good reason to say that reading can develop imagination. To begin with, books or articles usually do not have pictures. A good example is historical books. It was really hard for people to take pictures at that time. Therefore, people need to put more resources into imagining if they want to find out about that historical period. Moreover, when reading information, people also need to think harder than looking at the screen. Watching TV leave people unable to imagine. It has transition, and movement and can illustrate everything thus people do not need to use their imagination. \r\n\r\nThere is also a compelling reason to say that language skills can be improved through reading. First and foremost, there are a significant number of languages that are rare. Due to its scarcity, information about it is also minimal. To illustrate, if one language disappears, people could just find it through its nation's books. At that time, people did not have any technology devices so they just could take notes to save their languages. That is the reason why people will struggle to find any videos of their nation and languages because it happened a thousand years ago\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, reading not only helps improve imagination but also language skills.

This dependency can lead to some disadvantages. I agree with the notion that computers are useful in daily life but there are some demerits of using them. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the first and foremost reason for the operation of computers is that they are useful in our daily life routines. People can use them for chatting with their long-distance friends in every corner of the world. As a result, they can remain in touch and do not feel loneliness. Moreover, people can use them to watch the time of their buses, trains and planes. They can book tickets for their travel with the help of computers. For example, my friend is living abroad. We communicate with each other with the aid of applications that are available on laptops.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some cons if individuals do not operate them in a proper way. Firstly, with the excessive use of laptops, folks are facing the problem of weak eyesight because they are continuously watching at their screens which produces harmful rays that are dangerous for the eyes. Secondly, there are some schools that start teaching students with the assistance of computers. For instance, by having online classes.

We know that without consistency with work, we can not achieve success i.e. actually no pain, no gain. Some people think that it is very crucial to take challenges, both in their working lives and their personal lives. As Individuals are unable to get facilities without accepting risks, they think it has significant roles. For this reason, I would say that the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, in our professional stage to get a good job or obtain a high rank in a sector, workers need to spend their valuable moments and need to be more patient. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook which is a very common and useful social media in the modern age. He left  work only to produce the application system. In the meantime, he had to suffer from starvation, as he did not have much money. Though he had faced many admonishes, nowadays he has fame all over the world. Additionally, he has now an abundance of money which is vital to making his life dynamic. Moreover, making an excellent result in an exam is also tough. If any student does not complete his lessons regularly, he can not cope with the other talented pupils. To do this, he needs to study at least 8-10 hours  a day. After practising in such a way, he can cut a brilliant consequence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, accepting targets in all cases is not suitable because it has some detrimental effects on our bodies and minds. Such as  a person who wants to live on the planet Mars, this is not a proper idea to beat. As we know that it is not a possible task, we should ignore this thought. Furthermore,many job holders adulate their senior colleagues or boss to ascend the acme position rapidly. But  unfortunately, it works in a reverse way and the service man left  the job. It brings a miserable situation to his family and personality. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though there are both  merits and demerits to welcoming challenges, the benefits can outweigh the disadvantages.'",

This essay will suggest that owning loads of it is necessary in order to have quality relaxation periods and having more spare time allows you to feel, overall, more relaxed. \r\n\r\nIt is thought that  thanks to having a large capital, individuals can enjoy the small amount of it they have. Furthermore, when having a lot of money, people are able to book extravagant trips to foreign countries and live countless and luxurious experiences. For instance, my uncle has only 2 weeks per year of vacation because he spends all of his hours working towards building an empire. Though he might seem tortured, he is one of the happiest men alive as a consequence of how perfectly he manages those two weeks and creates unforgettable memories with the cash he owns.\r\n\r\nPeople also believe that money is not a crucial factor in having the knowledge of how to spend a free stretch. Moreover, it is possible to enjoy most of life with not much in capital since having a pleasure in life is accessible to everyone. For example, in the 2023 annual Harvard Social study, the results illustrated that  all in all, individuals with less cash were happier than those possessing a lot of it. Between the first category, 50% explained that their happiness was due to the simple yet qualitative life they have thanks to the important amount of leisure periods. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I personally think that having an important capital with little relaxation time is better than the opposite since it is possible to know how to organise these small periods of leisure in order to enjoy the most of it.'",

Whilst certain individuals claim that splurging money on libraries is a waste of resources, others contend the notion that new emerging technologies are capable of being a plausible substitute for libraries. It is my notion that although advancements in technology can furnish readers with the digitalized version of books, it is the environment and preservation of certain ancient books that cannot be replicated by technology.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, as we live on the edge of technology, people should be more reluctant to head towards digitalized and more environmentally-friendly options when it comes to reading books in libraries. Now that many breakthrough inventions accomplished in this era, readers can now have  access to the rarest readings and books in the world through numerous websites and online libraries. Countries and universities that are spending millions of dollars each year to maintain libraries can basically switch to  digitalized solutions, therefore, decreasing the operation expenses and diverting the resulting funds towards other shortcomings of  society and students. For example, universities all across the world now closing their libraries and establishing  centralized information management servers where readers can freely benefit from the resources available from the comfort of home. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, libraries have always been a cultural centre for many societies, encompassing historical information and artefacts that are worth beyond the monetary valuation. It should be underlined that restoring or keeping these libraries in pristine condition is a challenging work which necessitates  well-planned coordination and financial resources. Furthermore, the one thing that is impossible to create in an artificial environment is the ambience in these old libraries where you can almost travel back in time to feel these time periods through the centuries-old buildings and books that have been well taken care of.  To exemplify this statement, the Egypt government spends thousands of dollars each year to preserve and maintain the condition of one of the oldest libraries in the world, known as the Library of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite digitalized libraries being a more economically advantageous and pragmatic solution compared to physical ones, there are some properties such as historical importance.'",

Although I find this statement to be an extremely negative development for various reasons.\r\n\r\nWith a comparison between the way of communication by the last generations and nowadays, virtual communication is becoming more and more popular every day, as people tend to show more interest in this way of talking to others and this made the path for these technology companies to provide and upgrade their devices. As a result, most children are showing more interest in using them than before. Nowadays, a great number of kids own their own smartphones and mostly are using them to communicate with their friends through them which causes them to waste a significantly greater amount of their time to be involved in their friend's community and not be left behind. Smartphones are now an inseparable part of adolescents' lives. These devices, moreover, consist of some interesting features such as the capability of watching movies, playing video games, and reading e-books which seem mesmerising to many youngsters and grab their attention to spend hours on their phones. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this statement has various drawbacks. Firstly, it is extremely time-consuming as children may find themselves scrolling through social media for many hours without any reason which will take their time that has to be spent outside of the house playing with their friends and doing homework. On the contrary, the blue light of these devices will eventually have a damaging effect on their brain and their ability to think properly, as well as their ability to solve problems and deal with difficulties. This statement, furthermore, may lead youngsters to become unsociable and depressed over time. For instance, if a child only speaks to his friends through texting them, he would not be able to express his ideas clearly when it comes to face-to-face communication, which will make him depressed and anxious.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, to me, that is a horrible decision to let the kids use their phones as much as they want to since this will bring a variety of unforgettable damages while they are growing up, as this is the time when their brains are forming and can have huge drawbacks to their future.'",

Others feel it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for their qualification.' \n 'Text': 'The majority of university students opt for learning various fields as well as their major while others believe paying attention solely to their qualification is more crucial. This essay will discuss both views and suggest my opinion in favour of the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, focusing and doing one's utmost to qualify is considerable as it leads to profound education. To be specific, the more students concentrate on their fields, the more they are exposed to higher-quality knowledge and information. For example, a student who spends 10,000 hours reading a biology thesis is likely to understand the lecture and the textbooks easily compared to others who only studied for 1000 hours and learned other subjects. Thus, concentrating on their subject only and studying hard for their qualification often result in excelling and obtaining a deep knowledge in their fields. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, seeking various subjects in addition to their department enables people to experience various studies and to broaden their insight. Furthermore, studying a wide range of fields leads to flexible perspectives. For instance, people who learn Korean literature, social science, and biology will effectively comprehend social, environmental, and gender disparity issues as they have widened their knowledge and understanding. Hence, learning many subjects helps individuals to cultivate multi-abilities and deter them from having narrow perspectives. \r\n\r\nHowever, in my view, I believe that doing one's best and endeavouring to a qualification is needed since I highly benefit from obtaining my master's degree. I was able to learn an in-depth section of law, which is my major. Also, I found a job with a high salary and work-life balance. It was possible because I was more outstanding than other applicants as I studied further and harder. In conclusion, although some individuals think that studying different departments is favourable, I stress that solely focusing on qualifying is crucial.'",

The plant is a good source of oxygen, if continued deforestation occurs it will lead to serious consequences. Apart from, animals play a vital role in human life, if they also low extinct it is an environmental problem because it finishes the one Kingdom of species. For instance, building a factory of plastic bottles of tree cuts, and the garbage from industries returned by pets, and lost both species.\r\n\r\nMoreover, pollution is a major environmental problem that leads to many health-related problems, especially for children and old age groups.

While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that gaining as much information as possible related to the main subjects is more advisable. Two primary reasons for this are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that extending the horizon of knowledge could play a complementary role in fulfilling the future profession. According to my own experiences, a salient example of this could be learning Python programming language  geographic information systems and remote sensing students at universities, which can broaden their analytical skills in processing satellite images. So, rather than concentrating on the main subjects, learning about other subjects is likely to be more constructive in the future job.\r\n\r\nSecondly and even more importantly, though, is the fact that focusing  solely on the issue is likely to be insufficient as the pace of life increases significantly. For instance, having a grasp of psychological principles could provide a better company for doctors with their patients which, would climb the process of treatment. So, having grown up in a technology era, insisting on such a limited attitude would result in unsatisfying consequences.  \r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although studying for a qualification would lead to being an expert in a future job, spending time learning related subjects would be accompanied by significant advantages for the betterment of societies.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.' \n 'Text': 'The trend of full-time labour among women has created a balance of chores and responsibilities with their spouses. Personally, I am completely in the same boat with this notion. This phenomenon can lessen the degree of patriarchalism and reduce the fatherless issue in a family. I will try to explain both benefits based on the condition of my country, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nA current shift where mothers can achieve the same career opportunities as men might diminish the effect of patriarchism. It is a belief that exists in many regions, and consistently puts males as the top priority in any relations. To illustrate, in the early 1900s in Indonesia, females are entitled only to three places with three duties. Kitchen for cooking, bed for mating, and well for house working. However, since girls are able to enter the workforce, a lot has changed. Those who previously held patriarchy and overshadowed women all the time already realized that women are as capable as men. Thus, if initially, mothers were the only ones to handle housework, then nowadays fathers should be able to do it equally.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this alteration has the likelihood to alleviate the troublesome fatherless problems. As its name implies, fatherless means the lack of involvement or dad figure in daily life. Usually ensued as the breadwinner image being invoked on males. For example, a job can take up to 8 to 9 hours per day. It is true that from this, a husband can fulfil the financial needs of his youngsters. Nevertheless, it is also a hard pill to swallow that he will not have sufficient time to play with the children. Therefore, the psychological void will emerge within them. Fortunately,  modern belief has countered it, hence men can spend more moments with their sons or daughters. A family's income is not confined to one source anymore.\r\n\r\nOverall, once again, I am fully aligned with this concept. Two benefits have evidently been generated since females have  even-handed circumstances with their spouses at work. The social issue of patriarchy and fatherless parents can be lowered. In the future, I assume that this lifestyle will be proliferated in more countries. The advantages are really invaluable.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.' \n 'Text': 'The debate surrounding an ageing population has garnered considerable attention globally, with opinions sharply divided. On one hand, an ageing demographic is perceived as a challenge for governments; on the other, it is seen as a societal asset. This essay posits that the benefits brought by an elderly populace significantly outweigh the drawbacks, given their wealth of experience and continued economic contributions.\r\n\r\nFirstly, senior citizens are invaluable repositories of wisdom and experience, which they impart to younger generations. Their perspectives, shaped by years of diverse experiences, are crucial in guiding the youth and in policy formulation. Take, for instance, their role in shaping historical consciousness \u2014 many elders lived through pivotal events, such as the technological boom or significant political upheavals. Their firsthand accounts and insights are irreplaceable, ensuring that lessons from the past are not just remembered but integrated into current societal norms and decision-making processes. This intergenerational exchange fosters a society that is well-grounded in its history and more resilient to future challenges.\r\n\r\nMoreover, contrary to the belief that retirees are a strain on economic resources, many continue to contribute actively to the workforce. In countries like Japan, where the ageing population is notably high, older workers are not just participating but are essential in addressing labour shortages. Their presence in various sectors brings a balance of skills and perspectives, often leading to more innovative and empathetic workplace cultures. Additionally, their mentorship roles in organizations enhance knowledge transfer, ensuring business continuity and growth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though the phenomenon of people living longer than ever before is posing some challenges, these are far outweighed by the societal contributions made by the elderly. Their involvement in cultural preservation and continuous economic participation affirms their invaluable role. Societies rich in elderly citizens benefit from a wealth of history and experience, fostering more resilient and dynamic economic and social frameworks.'",

I completely agree that scientific discoveries and technological inventions should be solutions for any problems human beings may be or are currently facing in order to have a much better life. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, numerous inventions since the past have directly contributed to humankind and provided an easier life in the modern age. These inventions come in a variety of domains ranging from the health sector to telecommunications. Telephones invented by Alexander Graham Bell, for instance, have altered the way pupils communicate as the technology allows them to have two-way immediate conversations despite distance. Furthermore, the form and function of telephones have evolved exponentially as mobile phones nowadays are multifunctional with a wide range of activities accommodated, including internet and social media access. \r\n\r\nIn addition, fostering and accelerating the betterment of human lives through scientific efforts are actually the responsibility of scientists. They carry an enormous obligation to put their knowledge and expertise into service for the greater good, especially since human beings keep on witnessing challenges such as climate change, potential global or wide-scale infectious diseases, and poverty. One perfect example was the development of COVID-19 vaccines that involved a substantial number of scientists worldwide joining forces. It was proof of their commitment to saving lives and the way to showcase the immense influence of science during a humanitarian crisis. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, scientific exploration, in fact, possesses multiple aims.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is true that pollution is alarmingly becoming more serious due to the industries. While many people think that air and water pollution can be alleviated if the government expands the charges on numerous industrial areas, I agree with those who argue that other superior methods could be adopted to solve this problem. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is justified why some people advocate the view that paying extra charges might help to tackle the problem of pollution. To begin with, the quality of air and water resources could be improved considerably thanks to the punishment of paying a heavy tax. It is undeniable that the factories may release a myriad of harmful chemicals in plastic-making processes and clothing into the rivers which can put the marine ecosystem at a disadvantage to be able to exist. Therefore, the government is in charge of introducing the law such as paying the fine to the industries so that they will discharge fewer unused materials outside the environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I contend that several further outcomes can be implemented to improve the situation. Firstly, the authorities should encourage the factories to put more resources into the water treatment system. Using this system to deal with harmful waste before dumping it into the rivers can minimize the negative effects on the natural habitat. In addition, there is a need for factories to recycle as much as possible. This is perfectly exemplified in the case of putting advanced technology into practice so as to reduce wastes including unused wool and chemicals, and, use organic materials as a fuel replacement.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many benefits regarding increasing taxes on the industries, whereas, I believe that it is more beneficial to adopt other alternative measures.'",

In this regard, the educational system should not only focus on the pursuit of knowledge but also the development of good personality such as being patient, caring, and responsible. It should be noted that students might learn these skills in the classroom but would not have the chance to apply or practice them. However, interaction with people in community service allows them to build up those morals. It brings that knowledge of morality into experience in their life. for instance, helping orphans makes a contribution to earning social skills.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very competitive in applying to universities or jobs. Universities prefer influential students to adopt. For example, MIT University receives more than thousands of new applications each year. Most applicants obtained all A\u2019s results, so it is not easy to select the new intake students. At that time, their contribution to the community would make them distinguished among the applicants. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, without a shadow of a doubt, involvement in unpaid community service brings great benefits to shape the morality of teenagers and boost their chances of getting into tertiary education.

This leads to an imbalanced population between rural and urban areas. Some argue that this brings a positive impact on the country as a whole, while I believe that there are substantial negative consequences.\r\n\r\nLooking at the upsides of the moving population from the countryside, cities provide rural residents with greater resources and better future development. For example, urban areas are building an increasing number of business locations, housing sections and all kinds of construction, which requires a significant amount of workers. By contrast, suburbs lack a variety of occupations, and most of the residents there engage in more conventional work. People are seeking various opportunities to raise per capita income and improve life quality. Consequently, increasing numbers of employers from all sectors enhance productivity and therefore boost the economic growth of a country as a whole.\r\n\r\nHowever, the major drawbacks of a declining rural population can increase the urban-rural gap and result in unequal distribution of wealth. For instance, less labour force is devoted to traditional industries such as agriculture, farming or manufacturing, reducing the production of the primary sector and dramatically affecting the cost of those raw products. Furthermore, those who suffer from a production decline can result in a substantial reduction in their earnings, making the urban-rural gap far more severe.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although every country may experience this issue inevitably, we must take action on how to alleviate the challenges our countryside is facing and make adjustments to tackle the matters of decreasing labour force and revenues in the countryside.'",

This phenomenon is happening due to the lack of care from families. Overall, I firmly disagree with this contemporary habit as it has a degrading impact on children's ability to focus and social skills.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main contributor to this issue is the parents' ignorance of their heirs. To illustrate, many working parents spend most of their time outside of the house, thus, over-rely on the babysitter's role to take care of their offspring. Hence, the easiest way to soothe toddlers is by introducing them to consuming content on smartphones. For instance, I often watch mothers giving out gadgets as a shortcut to calm their toddlers every time I eat out at a restaurant. This kind of negligence builds the children's overdependent behaviour to gadgets.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, this habit is destructive to the toddlers' development. Firstly, children will become addicted to the sudden endorphin rush gotten from entertainment and, consequently, weaken their concentration capability from such an early age. For example, my 5-year-old nephew found it hard to recall his own address because of his outrageous addiction to computer games. Moreover, kids will not be exploring avenues outside their comfort zone and making new friends that build their social intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, families play a monumental role in overcoming the issue of the era. As the drawbacks of playing smartphones have undeniably detrimental impacts on children, I strongly opine that this is a negative development.

I strongly disagree with this perspective, as it is predominant for an individual to be aware of the facts behind every concept. This essay elaborates on the reason in the following paragraphs with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, There is a myth growing among youngsters of the current generation that is necessary for them to understand their syllabus without recognizing the benefits that renders to our society. Subsequently, they are more concentrated on improving their grades to win over their competitors. However, in a real sense, it is controversial to believe that, despite focusing only on subjects, it is advisable to know about its real-time implementation. To give a good example, university students can bring up innovative applications by applying their theories in a practical world. Thereby, this kind of study method results in an upward trend in developing countries. \r\n\r\nIn addition, students who concentrate on the development process instead of producing documentary context would be fond of a multitude of opportunities to prove themselves in a self-desired place that makes them feel gratified. For instance, people who are inclined to produce appealing products based on applied math and science which satisfy the public requirements, would help to grow an uptrend graph toward their longed designation.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, It is good to gain practical insights through their educational process to enrich the self and social existence.'",

        "input": "'Question': '2.It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going university. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?' \n 'Text': 'Taking a gap year off between finishing school and starting university has gained popularity in recent years. Moreover, the trend comes with several pros and cons worth considering. In my opinion, I believe that the benefit for students is to grow their personal development and career exploration, however, there are some detriments due to this delay that may impact study habits and affect long-term career goals.\r\n\r\nMany people support a period after high school as it can generate a wide range of benefits for adolescents. Those who give themselves a break between high school and university potentially could gain their personal growth as well as work experience. For example, it allows young adults to explore their interests and passions, together with the chance to gain work experience in their chosen field, providing insight into their future goals. Another thing worth pointing out is that it is the perfect time to improve academic performance and broaden your horizons, which could be by travelling to another country.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, large fractions of individuals argue that if students stay away from the educational environment for roughly a period of time, it will result in a delayed graduation. In the long, run they might be behind their peers in career progression. In addition, they may lose interest in studying, such as, if they have a chance to earn sufficient money they will not come back to the educational environment. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are strong arguments on both sides. Whereas the significance of resuming academic education is undeniable, teenagers who have undergone multiple pressures need to unwind before starting university. Therefore, I strongly believe that the superiorities of a year gap outnumber its downsides.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to only be meant for adults. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children.\r\n\r\nWhat are its causes, and what solutions can be offered?' \n 'Text': 'Being obese was once only a condition that adults suffered from, but it is becoming more common in youths. This essay will first discuss how fast food and a sedentary lifestyle are the primary causes of this growing problem and then outline how education and increased exercise are the most viable solutions.\r\n\r\nOne cause of obesity in youngsters is the increasing popularity of fast-food restaurants. Fast food usually contains an exorbitant number of calories because it is very high in fat and sugar. In addition, young people are living a more sedentary lifestyle. Nowadays, more adolescents choose computer games or social media over physical activity, so they are unable to burn the extra calories they are eating. It can be commonly seen in many Western nations, for instance, that the number of youth who participate in after-school sports has dropped significantly over the last decade.\r\n\r\nThe best solution to this problem of being overweight is to educate adolescents about the dangers of being severely overweight. If children are more aware of the types of diseases associated with chubbiness, they might think twice before asking their parents to take them to the local burger restaurant. Moreover, schools should introduce more exercise into their curriculums. If youngsters take part in sports, the physical activity will allow them to burn calories and avoid weight gain. Schools where youths are required to participate in at least one team sport, for example, typically have lower obesity rates.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many children are struggling with their weight because of eating too much junk food combined with a sedentary lifestyle. However, if schools give adolescents enough information about the risks they are taking by doing this and require children to do more exercise, the problem can be alleviated.'",

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Issues related to government support for elderly people are frequently discussed these days. Although some believe that old citizens should save money for their future lives, others criticize this and argue that the government should offer financial support and care to them. The two sides of this argument will be thoroughly discussed and analyzed in the essay before drawing a reasoned conclusion. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are some demerits associated with offering money to senior persons. First and foremost is the lack of financial management in some groups. To explain, aged individuals should prepare themself for their payments after retirement. For instance, hospital and doctor fees are a large number of expenses from all bills. Thus, If old people can take care of themself without support from the government, we can manage taxes to develop other pain points in the country which are transportation, health care, education, and others. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are several merits of this funding. The principal merit is youngsters and offspring can save their money from their parent's monthly expenses. In other words, they can purchase anything that they want so the country's economy will grow significantly. Moreover, their parents can look after themself so they have more time to focus on their work or businesses.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the two points of view of the argument concerning financial support to old people.

In my opinion, the government should prioritize honesty to the people.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are instances where the head of a country may need to withhold certain information from the public. For example, intelligence data could pose significant threats to a nation, especially when governmental leaders are negotiating with other countries.  Thus, keeping certain information classified will maintain an advantageous position in parleys or protect national security. Furthermore, restraining negative news related to societal and economic issues could help the country survive the crisis. Some people consider this a good measure to prevent mass panic and instability in the community.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that national authority should act as a role model of ethical standards to citizens.  A nation thrives on the trustworthiness and accountability of its governmental body. As a result, members of a society are inspired to act ethically in their own lives, leading to a more cohesive and compassionate community. Moreover, when leaders consistently live up to their promises, they communicate confidence in their actions and decisions to global politics. This trust will help build a healthy relationship with other countries. For instance, when Canada apologized for its violence against native people, the country gained credibility among its own citizens and a positive image on the international stage.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is necessary for politicians to be truthful when addressing the public.'",

This essay agrees that individuals now get  information about the world and read books on the Internet without paying any fund \r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is relatively cheap and convenient to get material online. This is because one does not have to travel and spend a lot of money before one gets information. With a little cash and a click on their phone or laptop, they get an array of news around the world, as well as more options of novels to read without stressing themselves.

Which of these situations do you think is better?\r\n\r\nUse specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. Be sure to use your own words. Do not use memorized examples.' \n 'Text': 'The young adult proponents seek independence from their household as early as possible whereas the opponents fancy staying at their parent's house for a longer period. I believe that living under the same roof with your family has some advantages. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, being housed together will save you a bunch of daily expenses such as rent, utilities, and food. Instead of spending your hard-earned money on these necessities, you could invest it in asset classes like stocks and mutual funds in order to grow your wealth faster. On average, financial experts estimate that costs consist of approximately half of someone's income, especially during this season of price inflation. Thus, shamelessly downgrading your life with your parents' providence will help you soar financially. \r\n\r\nSecondly, you can also build a more favourable kinship with your household members through day-to-day interactions and activities. A nurturing and supportive relationship is greatly impactful to young adults' views in life and performance at work. My best friend who bonds well with her siblings tends to be more cheerful and demonstrates positive behaviour towards others. At the end of the day, it's only the family who is willing to help you at your worst as blood is thicker than water. However, I do understand that not everyone was lucky enough to be born in a providing and warm household. Sometimes unexpected and poignant miseries happened like divorce and bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nAs someone with a broken family, living with either my mother or my father comes at the cost of my mental health and peace of mind. For this reason, part of me can relate to young adults who demand independence over their lives as soon as they're financially capable. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I stand for settling with family as the most preferable condition due to financial and relational reasons. But I do acknowledge and still respect some young adults who decide to live by themselves for they must have their own background. We can never choose in which kind of family we were born into, but we can always have a choice to build a better family of our own.'",

The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. \r\n\r\nDo you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'These days, every time we turn on television or flicking through the pages of newspapers, we learn about the impact of social media. There are some concerns about whether these platforms eliminate the direct interaction between people and people or not. In this essay, I will look at its pros and cons and also draw some conclusions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, overreliance on social platforms can lead to fewer connections in the community. A large number of users are surfing TikTok, and Facebook on a daily basis, for example, because the core content is so highly addictive and occupies the majority of their time. As a result, those who sit still in front of their smartphone's screen gradually forget about family reunions. Besides, some advanced functions and applications allow FaceTime, which means that they can call and have a face chat at any time of the day. However, without meeting in person, online calling will sometimes lead to misunderstanding if the internet connection is not stable or individuals cannot grasp the innermost thoughts of others. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, social networks are beneficial due to their convenience. There are some features from them that can help solve the problems, especially in case of emergency. For instance, an app called Zalo in Vietnam enables people to have a group video call even though there is no WIFI nearby, which facilitates transferring the news urgently without the need to gather. In addition, long-distance relationships are truly in high demand of  support from technology to carry on online calls since they are unable to see face-to-face at that moment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, social media does have positives and drawbacks in daily life. Although sometimes individuals can be overattached to it hence causing fewer reactions to family and friends, I do believe that the advantages can outweigh its disadvantages owing to its flexibility and excellent support.'",

For example, earning the amount of silver for spending monthly should be our aim instead of working overtime with a view to collecting  much of it in diverse banks and thus, this valuable paper should not take  control of our soul in a negative way. \r\n\r\nSecondly, there are quite a few prominent factors such as putting aside an array of time to spend with family members, paying attention to our mental along  physical health and so on.

This essay will explore how the drawbacks of working overtime outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several merits of clocking out late. The principal merit is that the more employees spend time on their tasks, the more they gain experience. To explain, there are many jobs that need a lot of working hours to become a professional. For instance, Architect is one of the occupations which require a number of skills and experience. Thus, a junior designer who holds many projects and works overtime to get the jobs done is significantly promoted to be a senior designer or a director.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some demerits associated with staying until night.

In my opinion, I would partially agree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo commence with the physical stores, online shopping will not be able to replace all existing shops. Firstly, there are products which need to be purchased by customer\u2019s after reaching a shop because they need to experience the product before purchasing it. For an example: - Purchase of an Automobile by a customer would always prefer to have a test run of the product before they purchase it, which requires the existence of physical stores. Secondly, there is always a customer segment that would not be encouraged by the growth of E-commerce platform as they are more comfortable to purchase products by visiting the store. Hence, the demand for physical shops will exists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, E-commerce platform has created an opportunity for business to operate economically, effectively, and efficiently. The growth of online shopping recently, have led businesses to open more virtual stores in their websites, as it is lucrative. Thus, leading to an increase in the closure of outlets but not all. Furthermore, it has enabled them to reach a wider community by overcoming many challenges with ease. For an instance: - With the expansion of online shopping, businesses are now able to sell their products to a large market without investing in outlets, which allows them to operate more efficiently and economically.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that the growth of E-commerce business will lead to an increase in the closure of outlets because of the opportunities it persists but it will not lead to a discontinuation of physical stores fully.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'An increasing number of professionals, such as doctors and teachers, are leaving their own countries to work in developed countries. What problem does this cause? What can be done to deal with this situation?' \n 'Text': 'These days, more and more professionals are choosing to relocate to more developed countries for work. This happens mainly because of a better economy and a variety of job opportunities in richer countries. This essay will explore the reasons for this trend and discuss the possible solutions.\r\n\r\nThere are some issues that provoke some employers, especially health practitioners and educators, to move abroad. Firstly, developed nations provide more facilities for these jobs, like hospitals and schools. Hence, it is easier for both teachers and doctors to find a job opportunity and even consider different places according to their preferences. Secondly, industrialised countries have better infrastructure which includes accessible transportation, and an efficient health and education system. For example, in Russia, some citizens from  small cities, such as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsh and Vladivostok, decided to move to Hong Kong and China, as these countries have a wide range of jobs with higher salaries for educators and doctors. \r\n\r\nSome measures can be taken in order to stop individuals from moving. If authorities of less developed nations take steps to increase the number of schools and hospitals, as well as to improve the quality of these facilities it will help to accommodate all the employees and give them a chance to choose the work they desire. Additionally,  convenient transit should be provided, so professionals can easily travel from their homes to work. Lastly, some perks and incentives should be offered to those who work locally and demonstrate loyalty to their position. For instance, in Australia, some companies provide extra bonuses in the form of money for those who have worked in their organisation for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is a major problem that many individuals decide to relocate to other countries for better lives. This problem can be tackled if the government improve the quality of life in less developed nations providing more facilities for employees along with better transportation and quality of education and medical system. Moreover, promoting local jobs with bonuses and incentives can encourage individuals to work locally.'",

Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.' \n 'Text': 'A group of individuals present the view that youngsters who are allowed to decide and choose their preferences on different subjects such as food, clothing and entertainment tend to put their own wishes above others in the future, whereas others believe that children should be allowed to decide on things which are associated with them. I wholeheartedly agree with the latter opinion as it plays a vital role in their growth process.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people justifiably believe that what children need is greater development which is accessible by being taught as well as freedom. Not only does giving the chance to choose enhance their self-confidence but also it is a decisive factor in augmenting their prowess. For example, children who are allowed to decide what they want to wear are more likely to excel at addressing a problem as they have to choose logically or emotionally. Therefore, allocating freedom for children results in flourishing in their future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of society argue that giving freedom to decide brings about being arrogant as these children are willing to consider their needs more important than others. However, I do not find this argument convincing since rarely does it happen that freedom through the parents' observation leads to arrogant children as they are taught that others' needs are as substantial as theirs. In addition, if they have an opportunity to experience dealing with different challenges, they will be more prosperous in the future. For instance, youths who have asked about the destination of a trip feel more valuable and responsible for the consequences of that travel.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my view, teenagers should be allowed to decide as it has a crucial role in their development and nurture. Moreover, parents should teach their offspring to consider every detail in their decisions and assist them to thrive.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Many people think that children should be taught in school to recycle unused material, while others say that this training should be given at home. This article will discuss both views before a final statement.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the major benefit of teaching students about reusing material and avoiding junk at school is the expertise of mentors. In other words, teachers are trained professionals who can effectively communicate the principles of recycling and staying away from waste to students. Moreover, schools provide a structured and organized learning environment where children can receive formal education on various subjects, including recycling.  For example, in international-level schools like DPS, teachers use a variety of graphs and pictures to give a demonstration to younger ones so that they can understand every aspect of recycling with the help of visuals and put it into practice in their lives. Thus, providing guidance to students about recycling material and avoiding waste is beneficial.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, progenitors play a significant role in shaping their juvenile\u2019s values and habits. Put differently, children are more likely to adopt the behaviour of recycling and avoid using waste and carry it into adulthood when parents actively practice and teach recycling at residence . In addition, learning about recycling at home can be more flexible and adapted to individual family routines and lifestyles. Parents can give the lessons to suit the child's age and level of understanding. For instance, mentors can aware their kids about worthless goods such as plastic items, and cardboard items, which are also found  at residences, and have ceased to be used. Hence, progenitors can offer a real-world demonstration of the principles of recycling.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having engaged in the subject, in my opinion, schools should include recycling education in their curriculum; nevertheless, parents must actively participate in teaching and practising recycling at home to their adolescents.'",

This essay discusses why I feel this is happening and explores the measures governments need to take to bring this under control.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons that I believe can be attributed to the increase in rubbish in modern life. The primary reason is the growth of online shopping. Online shopping is convenient and it makes it so easy for people to purchase goods around the clock. The problem is that all these goods are packaged to ensure safe delivery before being dispatched to the consumer and as a result, all this packaging is discarded. The second reason is the change in people's lifestyles, especially those who live in cities. For instance, more and more people are eating out in restaurants and fast-food outlets, which translates into the usage of more plastic food containers and utensils which will inevitably increase the amount of non-biodegradable plastic refuse.\r\n\r\nThere are several measures governments can take to remedy this challenging issue. The most effective measure is for governments to pass laws to mandate the use of recyclable packaging. At the same time, online advertising needs to be used to encourage online shoppers to deposit used packaging in recyclable bins. Secondly, governments can introduce regulations which limit the usage of polluting products such as plastics. For example, several laws can be put in place requiring restaurants to use utensils that can be washed, sanitized and reused.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, more garbage is being created due to the growth of online shopping and changing lifestyles. However, if governments regulate business and introduce laws to encourage more environmentally friendly practices, this can be reduced to a manageable level.'",

Some think that these taxes are a good idea while others disagree.

Two sides emerged: those who agree with it and those who oppose it. Both parties present solid arguments, which will be discussed below and attached with a personal opinion.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, those who praise the tax movement as a good idea are likely to originate from a country that exhibits a radical sugar problem. They see this as a solution to fix unhealthy habits and overweight individuals, believing that this will potentially enhance the lives of citizens. Countries like America, for instance, suffer from high sugar consumption, which leads to an increase in obesity in highly populated areas. With the tax reform, the number of disgusting intake will likely shrink, therefore, adopting a healthier outlook for the people.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, those who oppose the tax reform, say that this is an attack on an individual's freedom. They argue that every person has rights and that they are allowed to buy and consume as much as they desire. Consequently, by limiting that privilege, there could be damaging consequences. For example,  a sudden change like this could cause an uproar in many places; riots will ensue and protesters will take their hysteria to the streets. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I personally believe that this is a positive implementation because it will shape a better image for people and for nations. However, the process should be steadily progressive; starting with smaller regulations before moving onto the primary goal of taxing. It is a messy development, but one that yields greater results.'",

In many nations around the universe, countryside individuals are transferring to urban areas, so the population in the village is decreasing. The essay describes both views and it is a negative practice with the statement from my inclination. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, humans are always inclined to lead a happy and healthy life in a sound environment. For that process, they easily can stimulate their brain to perform any complex task. For example, scientist Neutron spent his whole life in a countryside area. Consequently, he easily focused his concentration on increasing analysis habits for innovation. In addition, food production is one of the fundamental things for surviving creatures of mankind. To continue that process, people have to invest their knowledge and ideas in the field of agriculture sectors to live in village areas. To give an example, some skilful persons can undoubtedly give time to improve how to grow paddy, rice, and maize more in a scientific way. As a result, a country can enhance its stability in a sustainable way to maintain food security.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many young professionals have to lead their lives in rural areas to serve illiterate people. For this reason, some people are encouraged to spend their time in the village with family.  For instance, by teaching their students, a good teacher can change the behaviour of youngsters. Therefore, one who will watch a dream how he successes in his career with great effort. Besides, a large population in city areas can create  worse environmental problems. In accordance, Dhaka is the third air air-polluted city in the world.

Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do the advantages of having an egeing population outweigh the disadavantages?' \n 'Text': 'Human\u2019's longevity is better than at any time in the past in many developed nations. While there are numerous benefits associated with living longer, the drawbacks of this trend overshadow the positives.\r\n\r\nA few advantages arise from this phenomenon. First of all, more older people will let companies have more options in recruitment; moreover, the elderly are often more experienced and have better knowledge than younger workforces. For instance, research focused on enterprise recruitment indicates that the age group 50-60 has the best performance in the company and they often take crucial positions such as senior managers. Older people at the age of 50-60 are often reliable, hard-working, and complain less than other age groups \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, from my perspective, the negatives of this phenomenon outweighed the benefits. Because of the availability of older workers; younger are have fewer opportunities for their jobs; therefore, leading to an increase in unemployment. Furthermore, the elderly are incapable of doing highly required physical jobs. Secondly; governments in many countries have to spend more money on medical services for older people. It will come from taxes of younger age groups and it can turn out to be a financial burden.  For example, the US proclaimed last year that higher taxes workers must pay are due to increased demand for free medical services for the elderly. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as medicine and technology are developed significantly; humans tend to live longer.

I personally believe that this issue can have many advantages and disadvantages, in other words, this is two sides of a penny but in my personal perspective, the disadvantages of this issue outweigh the advantages due to the reasons which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nObviously, young people are the most precious group in every country and can play a key role in their countries' fate because of some factors like body health. Moreover, this is crystal clear that young people have more energy to do more duties but under no circumstances does this situation last forever. I mean by the passage of time everybody gets old and loses their ability. This is the nature of any living creature. Therefore anybody can not count just on his today. For instance, my grandfather  built a very huge marvellous stony bridge when he was young but before he  passed away, he was even not able to go to the bathroom by himself and was totally disabled.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to youngsters, any old individual not only has not his full health but also may have some serious problems and need someone to care for him. As I mentioned at the top this crowd of lower-age people will get old and by looking to the nowadays society we can recognise  this trend after a hundred years, and then that country has to accept immigrants and pay them just for taking of the old nation it has. By way of example, Iran was a young country but now its population is middle-aged and  very soon they need foreigners' help to manage vulnerable inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this is true that countries need to have powerful workers and it is perfect to have more of them but they have to make a balance between over and under ages to prevent long-term problems. To put it in a nutshell having a balance in this problem is the best choice for survival in all time.'",

These innovations accelerate the process of communication, lessen the barriers to it and keep people updated.

In the first place, it helps the viewers buy what they need and provides instruction to them. For example, some cleaning accessories can be introduced to the public and provide a helping hand to them by providing detailed video instructions on television. In the second place, people can take a break while watching a film or documentary. In fact, some documentary movies can last three to four hours and audiences can get lost easily and become fatigued. For the sake of providing a better experience, taking a 5-minute break every 15 minutes is good for them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when it comes to advertisements, there are opinions that it creates unnecessary buying and waste. First of all, the business strategies of most companies are profit-driven and they want audiences to buy their products. In order to increase their sales data, as a matter of fact, the commercial always misleads the viewer with attractive and vivid animation. Finally, the buyer bought what they wanted instead of what they needed. Additionally, the product broadcasts interrupt the mood of watching a show. For instance, it is not difficult to notice that the TV programmer usually arranges the advertisements just after an exciting scene. If you want to continue enjoying the show, then you need to look at their product introduction first.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are citizens who think that TV advertisement arrangements can improve the enjoyment of viewers meanwhile others say no. After carefully reviewing the argument for both sides, I find myself strongly agreeing with the statement that TV commercial helps viewers a lot.'",

On the other hand, the rest of the dwellers think that the process is not rare as well and they do not feel like paying any attention to it.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, In our life , we are super busy building a better life in order to enjoy our future days. For this reason, we do not have enough hours to search which products are launched nowadays. In that case, Advertisements are the best way of learning about the components. Besides, Individuals can be informed about the element's activities and the benefits of its use. Such as, with new branded soaps, we can easily know  all the advantages and disadvantages of their behaviour that can help us to choose which are suitable for our body. Moreover, when we have knowledge relevant to a product, for instance, its values, qualities,  usefulness, and procedure of use, then the sellers become unable to cheat  or  betray  customers.\r\n\r\nThough it has numerous benefits, it has some problems also that we face. Firstly, it is so  life-consuming and repeats several times that is exactly boring. Sometimes when we watch any important documents, or movies or try to gather information, in that moment, we feel it so annoying  and try to skip it. For example, A student whose exam is knocked at the door,  watches a tutorial class , at that point, the repetition of advertisements is harmful to him because it kills his valuable moment.\r\n\r\nFinally, In my opinion, Advertisements have some merits and  demerits. But as we can get  updated news and  unknown information that's why it is very significant for us. By watching it, many of us, basically, women generally buy these products.'",

This essay will evaluate the merits and demerits of using formal examinations. An opinion would be substantiated at the end.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the advantages, formal examinations will set the foundation for a reliable assessment. Students who have gained the relevant technical expertise in the area that they specialize with can be assured of the technical knowledge which they possess. Therefore, this creates an opportunity for them to be employed in a skilled job. For an example: - An individual who makes decisions regarding finances with a certified qualification in accountancy is recognized more than a person who is making decisions with no qualification. Secondly, this would be a common yardstick to evaluate many candidates at once, which can be used for many purposes by the evaluator with a higher evaluation accuracy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, exams do not appraise the full scale of a student\u2019s ability. Firstly, it does not evaluate the soft skills of a person because the attitudes and the personality of an individual will not be judged, and this is crucial when it comes to employment. Furthermore, tests may limit the assessment of problem-solving capability of a candidate in a practical situation. This is an essential skill. For an instance: - In the corporate world, most of the work scenarios require individuals to be working under a lot of pressure and it is important at these times to manage your work while managing your team efficiently. Hence, this demands a lot of leadership skills, which is not evaluated through a formal examination.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I partially agree with the statement that the benefits of formal exams outweigh the drawbacks always, because formal tests provide an insight into a person\u2019s capability but does not guarantee their performance in a real situation.'",

This situation has both benefits and drawbacks. This article explores the significance of embracing risks, delving into both the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, taking risks can lead to remarkable rewards. It allows us to step out of our comfort zones and achieve personal growth. Individuals can develop new skills and have valuable experiences by taking chances in growth. For instance, someone who decides to start their own business may face financial uncertainty initially, but the potential for success and financial independence can be immensely rewarding. Thus, the willingness to take such chances can lead to innovation and progress in various aspects of life.\r\n\r\nDespite undeniable advantages to taking chances, there are also potential downsides. Specifically, uncertainties can sometimes lead to failure or setbacks, causing financial, emotional, or even physical harm. For example, a person who invests all their savings in a high-risk venture might face financial ruin if it does not come out as expected. Moreover, excessive risk-taking can lead to stress and anxiety, affecting one's mental and emotional well-being. Hence, there are some downsides to stepping into danger with courage and determination. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having discussed the topic at length, it is important to embrace opportunities for growth and progress; however, it is essential to approach risk-taking with caution and a well-informed strategy to minimize potential drawbacks. Therefore, in my opinion, the benefits of taking risks often outweigh the disadvantages, provided that we do so thoughtfully and responsibly, ultimately leading to a richer and more fulfilling life.'",

Discuss the two views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In our contemporary, knowledge-driven society, possessing academic qualifications is paramount. There are contrasting viewpoints regarding whether the government should dictate university majors or if students should have the freedom to select their preferred fields of study.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the argument, proponents of government intervention in subject allocation argue that it can alleviate issues related to unemployment and labour shortages in specific sectors. In certain industries, there exists either a surplus of job opportunities with a scarcity of qualified candidates or an oversupply of qualified individuals without suitable employment. With government oversight, authorities can allocate more university slots for fields suffering from a workforce deficit and fewer slots for industries saturated with labour. This strategy promotes balanced competition and, consequently, reduces unemployment rates. Moreover, it can address the problem of insufficient skilled labour in emerging sectors, thereby fostering their growth.\r\n\r\nConversely, an opposing viewpoint asserts that allowing students to choose their majors based on their interests fosters intrinsic motivation. When students study subjects that align with their passions, their enthusiasm and engagement increase significantly. This heightened interest can drive them to excel academically because they willingly invest more time and effort in delving deeper into their chosen subjects. Additionally, when students have the freedom to select their academic paths, they can tailor their education to align with their career goals, adapt to their learning progress, and address their weaknesses. This approach facilitates a holistic and well-rounded learning experience.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while both approaches offer advantages from different angles, personally, I believe that authorities should empower the next generation by allowing them to choose their fields of study based on their preferences, as this approach is more conducive to their overall development.'",

In my opinion, losing hope creates more problems and a person should focus on the goals without thinking of the current circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to get a satisfactory profession while dealing with all the expenses on a low budget. To illustrate, getting a degree is a problem due to high fees and an individual cannot effort, hence they do not achieve the goals of  better work opportunities. Moreover,  a man without money do not have many options in regards to jobs, and only struggle to stabilize the financial conditions even if  the profession is not   favourable. It is better to have a career  rather than be unemployed. Similarly, living a dream life is not possible for all human beings so  one  should try to make the best out of what he or she has.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  everyone should do an effort to establish their dreams, which is better than losing hope.

This essay discusses both sides of this argument and why I believe that older people precious than youngsters.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, there is a group that supports the notion that youth has intrinsic value than other age groups and the main reason why this group thinks that is because they are the future. Hence, if a country wants to build a bright future, establish a stable economy, and create jobs, it should start with its youth. Thus, to manifest these desired goals a regime should be invested in young adults through sponsoring talents, offering good education, and most importantly to spending on science. Furthermore, kids have the ability to absorb lessons faster than seniors, so this is to say that kids have the potential to be the modified edition of someone old mistakes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a consensus that wants to divert its focus and energy towards seniors and this is due to the fact that they have an abundance of experience. Eventually, older citizens will have passed their experiences to the younger generation. For instance, the main source for stories, tales, and myths came from our previous generation.

This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, intellectual thinking defines the athlete. In other words, this skill is behind the other possible players' capabilities. For instance, even if a footballer is heavy, if he is stripped from abilities to think swiftly to dominate his opponent, he soon loses the ball possession. As a result, his football team never gain the match, which means he as a sporter fails. Furthermore, the most famous world players on the planet are because of their intellectual abilities, and not their strong bodies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, stamina balances a competitor. Because every sport needs movement, it is relevant to be strong for sake of offset. The recent research carried out by the UK football confederation pointed out that the overwhelming majority of professional clubs like Manchester United , Barcelona, and Real Madrid prefer football players with a high level of stamina due to their stability during the match for example. Hence, the extremely tight selection is made to hire a professional these days.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, notwithstanding physical strength to be crucial to some game aspects, intelligence capability is the one that defines a successful rookie.

For instance, the recent research carried out by the University of Exeter pointed out that 70% of Boys and Girls who were well-succeeded in their pursuits had parental role mode in earlier stages of their life.  As a result,  societies gain  valued members aimed at its development.

This essay will be discussing some factors and some measures that should be taken to solve the issue. \r\n\r\nOne of the first problems of why big cities in many areas are becoming noisy is that the number of people who employ private vehicles is increasing. The sounds of engines and clack sounds of the automobile are overused. As a result, this produces too much noise in the environment. For example, in New York City, the USA, most people do not take public transport, they use their own cars instead. Thus, the noises of their automobile are making too much noise which is considered annoying for some citizens. \r\n\r\nA  possible solution to this problem would be to take public transports for the local citizens if they want to commute from one place to another. This is believed effective to reduce the amount of noise generated by private cars as they are taking the public commuters. For instance, in Japan, the public is required to utilise public transport to move from one place to another. This is clearly potent in deducting the noise in cities. Consequently, the cities are freed from too loud noises. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, too much noise in ample public premises in urban regions is owing to some issues, one of which is too many private transports used by the local communities. Therefore, a possible solution that needs to be done is by taking public transports to go from one place to another.'",

I advocate strongly with these statements and am going to reflect on this essay my own view of such a common issue and to discuss both opinions.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it can be inferred that a large number of the population is right. First of all, a more detailed look at this trouble affords the population to conclude the core benefits of tour guides. For instance, the qualified person knows a substantial total of the information about the local environment and he can be so useful assistant during the trip. Secondly, staffers of various tour agencies possess  special knowledge of a place, where they perform their duties. Hence, tour guides may help people in various situations,  which tourists often encounter. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can be spotted that the population embark to travel without tour groups.

In addition, tourists admit that a travel agency provides very expensive trips and some people do not have the possibility to make a purchase of them. However, destinations, which are organised by agencies, are more informative and fascinating in contrast to individual trips.

Moreover, they would be able to save money on a larger quantity for their future years. For instance, under serious medical conditions if the patient leaves in the countryside, so a lot of time will undergo to reach the hospital.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The decisions should be made by only supervisors or executives, according to some people. Other people, nevertheless, opine that everyone in a company should be involved in making these things. In my opinion, all members should decide on their own jobs. Both sides along with my perspectives linked to the topic will be outlined in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThere are many arguments in favour of all action should be taken by managers. The most important one is that most managers are graduated with a master degree or bachelor degree. There is a universal consensus that almost all universities are more likely to teach their students to know more about the various aspects of business such as finance, marketing, operation, and countless business fields. Additionally, most supervisors are trained to make  difficult stuff with the best outcome. As a result, they are opted to set the company goals. For example, most higher-rank employees, including Tim Cook, who graduated from an MBA program tend to head the club's long-term goal . \r\n\r\nThere are, however, a host of arguments put forward against all decisions based on only the executive team. First and foremost, one significant counterargument is that operators always understand the detail of their shop-floor jobs more than their bosses do. Without a doubt, most employees can sometimes give invaluable ideas to make a better party's decision. Without the involvement of every employee, the group hardly can move forward. Consequently, Chief Executive Officer should encourage all members to involve in the process of decision-making. An outstanding example would be that startup companies allow all staff to find the common goals that everyone will achieve. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though making company's way by higher-rank staffs has various reasons, I am of the opinion that everyone should be involved in the process. Unless only executive teams decide everything, it is more likely that the growth of the community will increase insignificantly.'",

To what extent do you agree of disagree' \n 'Text': 'Arguably, it is commented whether the world-ruling power should use public funds sensitizing and mobilizing citizens to avert sickness or it should allocate the same money to individuals cure. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since it is worthy of preventing  rather than treating. Although a cure is less spending than prevention. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, Prevention glosses over severe illnesses. In other words, spending financial resources warning individuals has shown to be the efficient development to prevent diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and coronavirus. For instance, if the world cabinet did not heavily disseminate protective measures to hinder the coronavirus pandemic many people could have died. As a result, more public funds could have been wasted on crowd treatment. Furthermore, it is the overriding reason for a shrunk number of coronavirus pandemic deceased throughout the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a patient cure is less national money-consuming than averting. Because of the availability of medical drugs across the earth, healing folk into hospitals use fewer government resources. For example, solely in the first year of the actual pandemic, each Africa nation allocated a billion to purchase masks, soaps, and alcohol. However, solely a quarter of  an equal amount was enough to care for those hospitalized. Hence, the spared money is allocated to other government priorities like education, roads and security. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding some drawbacks result in more investment to promote a healthy lifestyle, it avoids severe illness and medicinal internation, and especially it reduces the population death toll. Therefore I still strongly agree with the view. I recommend local authorities to allot more crowd taxes in mobilization.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'In the concurrent world, people can enjoy  advanced technology and convenient internet. The folk can connect to a load of information, but they may not analyse whether it is correct or not. Also, we cannot deny that we do have lots of choices since we can easily access  the cyber in our generation whereas our parents may not have these benefits in their generations. This essay is going to discuss both pons and cons and my own opinions. \r\n\r\nFirstly, since the 18 century, the factories had huge improvements. This can convey that the production can be rapidly increased. Additionally, those companies can devote themselves to inventing more kinds of products. As a result, we do have various choices. This can have several benefits. For example, we can pick a suitable restaurant before we actually eat. Although it might have a host of shops to choose from, we can google it before we get in. In addition, the community can make the right decision. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it may have unexpected consequences. The folk may be annoyed due to enormous patterns. Unlike the last few decades, they were living in an infertility world. Hence, they have no other alternative choice. However, we may be bothered by too many things since we living in a complicated society. It may eventually lead to mental health because of the anxieties on deciding such as insomnia.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I do think that it has its sunny sides.

Although a miserable fault and learning from that can build a psychologically strong man, I personally do not agree with that statement because one evil step can make a child suffer and therefore parents can help them with their life experience.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is obvious that self-correction people remember the error for the life and it prevents them to do the same. Learning from blunders is normal in grown-up individuals ,however, it is something that the young generation can adopt from an early age for their mind build up. For example, the famous tennis player Mr Roger Federer was a rich spoiled brat, he did so many non-sportsman activities on the tennis court including breaking rackets and harassing the opponents, he had not listened to his coach before he realised his awful acts. At the time he understood his faults he transformed himself as one of the most generous tennis players of all time inside the court as well as outside. Nonetheless, everybody is not as lucky as Roger, nowadays adolescents are making serious mistakes such as taking drugs, involving in gambling and even murder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  gentle parental guidance can prevent a young lad from committing juvenile delinquency. As  human beings grow up they gather experiences from their own activities or learn for others life events; this knowledge can be shared with the offspring to prepare them to face the world. For instance, when a child grows up in an extended family, he gets a lot of attention and care from the family members especially grandparents, and grandparents can easily find if  the grandchild has been involved with a bad company. Thus, growing up in a nuclear family helps the little one to grow in a safe and secure environment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though making mistakes can prepare a person mentally, it also falls at the risk of committing a crime and it is,  hence, I am personally in the favour of parental guidance.'",

As time progresses competitions are increasing tremendously, and in order to have and provide a decent life humans must work more and harder than their ancestors. A recent article that was published in the Guardian stated that compared to 20 years ago people's working hours had increased from 6 hours daily working to 9 hours. Therefore , when the breadwinner comes home other family members might be sleeping and it is difficult to find time to have a family meal.\r\n\r\nAlthough financial stability and providing the best life quality for our youngsters is something essential. Children need attention, care , and guidance from their parents. For example, dinner is a perfect opportunity to build children's self-esteem by listening to what they are saying. Moreover, it will teach them about family dynamics.so by not having that children could take the wrong route such as misbehaving at school, or  start smoking, drinking alcohol and even sometimes they take life-threatening drugs like heroin. Hence , it is a moral obligation that every parent should guide and speak to their offspring frankly and the best way to do it is at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while most parents are busy making a living and trying to give their kids the best opportunities, they are missing precious quality time that could be easily achieved by having at least one meal with the whole family.'",

To extend do you agree?' \n 'Text': 'It is questioned if the government should give more money to education than the arts. On my behalf, I think that, in some way, art is a way of cultivating people too. Accordingly, it shouldn\u00b4t be possible to choose one. After all, places such as museums, galleries, exhibitions, concerts, dancing and other performances, form part of today\u00b4s education and even if the state had a bigger budget for schools, these institutions alone will never be enough. \r\n\r\nFirstly, in my opinion, all kinds of creative and artistic professions are very difficult nowadays. An example of this is the theatre. Not only because it requires a frequent adaptation and inconstancy but also due to the lack of value these persons receive. Furthermore, the enfluensive society members should cultivate these departments in order to decrease the state responsibility. After all, it concerns all of us. \r\n\r\nSecondly, assuming that the education would have more money, what would be the advantages? Will these profits be seen? Even if that actually made a difference in the academic formation it could bring a bigger impact on our children\u00b4s knowledge about the world. For example, art is essential through visual learning. Consequently, it is easier to retain certain information when we have an interaction with it, rather than reading something about the past or just memorizing it. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, my opinion is extremely against this statement. Besides educational purposes, artistic works are important to humans daily lives. Nonetheless, it brings people joy, distractions, interests and imagination. Altogether, disvaluing the arts will have consequences for all of us.'",

Is this a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'These days, societies are given different career opportunities. Having different career options makes it more likely people move their accommodation as well for a number of times. This essay will discuss the issue of whether this gives society a positive or negative impact on their life. In my opinion, this is certainly positive as people can have more horizons and be avoided from boredom. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one of the reasons why the public tends to alter their profession and house is that they believe by doing so they will obtain more new horizons. It is argued that the profession and house alteration could offer individuals new insights and knowledge from the population that he or she meets in a new place. For instance, I have a sister who has changed her job frequently and moved to another place to live several times. She says that this allows her to have new skills which are needed to gain a better job in the future. Therefore, it is worth it to somewhat shift the occupation a couple of times. \r\n\r\nSecondly, moving out and in from one place to another in order to have a different career and home is promising to avoid being bored. It is commonly acknowledged that having the same environment and meeting the same people are somehow resulting in being bored. Consequently, the workers cannot work optimal and perform well at work. For example, when I used to be a teacher at a school five years ago. I worked for the school for three years and turned out to work badly as I was feeling bored in the same atmosphere for a quite long time. Thus, changing a new job more than once can give persons the motivation to perform well at work. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though changing careers several times might sound strange for some people, for others this can be preferable as they are more likely to have new experiences and avoid boredom. In my personal view, this is positive since the societies are given opportunities to gain more new perspectives and escape from being bored.'",

This essay will discuss the reasons why people do this and give my opinion on whether or not this is promising for the public as a whole. \r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why today\u2019s generations are likely to shift their occupations is that they are generally unsatisfied yet with their current job. This is because they might not feel adequate with the number of the salary that they earn from the job. As a result, they tend to change their job more than once. Another reason is that individuals want to have experience in different types of jobs. Some persons think that having more distinct jobs means having more experience which is considered crucial to getting a better job in the future. Thus, it is worth it to change the job several times for a better future. \r\n\r\nMoreover, changing a few careers during life is deemed promising. This is because by doing this, it will be beneficial for obtaining more horizons. In other words, the public can get more experiences as they will meet new people and new systems in different places. For instance, I have a brother who has changed his work many times, and he says that he gets some new insights and skills every time he works in a different place. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why people are more likely to change their jobs throughout their life such as dissatisfaction with the current job and willingness to get more experience. In my personal opinion, this condition imparts positive impacts as people can gain more new knowledge and insights from distinctive circumstances.'",

Meanwhile, some believe that change is always a good thing and are open to new things in life. This essay will discuss both views and give my personal opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a few individuals are fortunate enough to figure out early on what profession they are interested in and are eager to pursue. They continue to pursue their passion without exploring other options. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as in most cases they end up happy wherever they are. For instance, Elon Musk was always interested in becoming an engineer and wanted to do something unique for the world. He went on to build his own electric car company which manufactured cars that would not require a driver. Additionally, some folks may have responsibilities that compel them to not try different options such as people with a low income and poor living facilities. They are forced to continue with their job lifelong until retirement.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people who take a chance and explore new options and fields find themselves fascinated and content. Some individuals take a gamble and pursue what they love later on in life. They may not always be successful but they are happy they tried. For example, Actor Rowan Atkinson had studied engineering and hoped to find a job in that field but his efforts proved to be futile. He tried his hand at acting and became a part of a show called 'Mr. Bean' which gained him worldwide popularity. Lastly, trying new things may not bring us success but it does enlighten us with new knowledge and experiences.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do believe change can lead to positive developments and if a person has the opportunity to test new things in life then they should absolutely try it. We should not take an opportunity for granted.'",

Some believe that it is the responsibility of businesses to pay for this training for their staff while others feel it is up to the individual.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In this competitive corporate ,world it is necessary for many positions to have updated training and research with the advent of technology. While some would argue that employers are responsible for the payments, others believe that individuals ought to pay by themselves. Although when an employee can make reimbursement for the tuition, it eases financial circumstances, I personally believe that any career improvement course should be personal.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, in most   cases when a company pays for the training ,cost it gives  financial support. Spending for a personal development course after maintaining a family is an adamant task for most   people and if this money comes from the organization, a sense of security comes to mind.  For example, recruiting company Hayes did an on-job education  servay where the data shows most of the applicants had not had pay from their pocket before they received any incentives from their employers. However, I believe that this approach takes out the freedom because there are some companies that make legal agreements before saying yes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if it is paid by self, it gives  personal freedom to choose the subject, trainer and institution. In personally financed education trainee does not need to wait for the approval of the manager or board members and hence, this training can be secret. For instance, I have purchased a few  skill development coursed on Udemy and I can  watch them over and over and get the information needed. In addition, I can email or phone  the instructors for any help or doubt. Thus, I am convinced that any development courses whether if for work or not should be financed by the individuals. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is mandatory for some jobs to have training as the world is evolving with technology and the Internet. While the payment by the company can give  temporary relief, in the long ,run it may create problems and it is ,therefore, I think own payment is better.'",

I personally believe that this trend has positive sides such as cost-effective higher education and  reduces carbon-di-oxide emission; the negatives are lacking in interpersonal communication  and poor students cannot use the advent of technology. \r\n\r\nOne of the principal advantages of having the latest technologies is that individuals can achieve higher degrees at a minimal cost. Loads of universities are offering long-distance study programmes nowadays where learners do not need to attain in person. For example, a number of private schools from the UK have distance learning systems and they offer a variety of courses all over the Globe. One of my friends has received a Master in Information Technology from the prestigious Leeds University, while he lived in his home country Bangladesh. Moreover, online teaching platforms might be environmentally friendly. If  traditional schooling is off, people will not commute to their respective institutions and this will reduce carbon emissions in the air. \r\n\r\nOne of the major disadvantages of the online learning system is that it is not suitable for all nations yet. There are some countries where basic necessities are hardly met; it is going to be an adamant duty for the Governments to set up costly infrastructure. For instance, more than sixty per cent of South Sudan citizens are living in the poverty and they cannot think about broadband connections at home. In addition, internet-based schooling has another problem which is undeveloped interpersonal skills. When undergrads work together in a room, they interact and understand the gestures of other students therefore it helps them in professional life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, online teaching might not be suitable for all nations and it does not help to develop some social skills,however, it benefits people to get an honorary degree from a foreign university while working and staying in a different place as well as it has a green impact on the environment.'",

It is a burden for them to maintain the basic necessities for living and consequently, they cannot think about higher studies. For example, a renowned private NGO named 'Brac' did a survey on mass primary literacy in Bangladesh in 1992 and the top reason parents answered regarding not sending their offspring to elementary schools is poor economical conditions. In response to this Bangladesh Primary and Mass Education Ministry made free of tuition fees till the secondary level and now  it has around seventy per cent secondary passed population. Thus, it is obvious that if higher education authorities make after higher secondary level free, that state will become rich in highly educated individuals.\r\n\r\nBachelor, master and research degrees among the mass population can make a nation wealthy. People study to make money for their won and country gets benefited by it too. When any society has more educated people, the authority could involve them in scientific research, send them to other countries where skilled workers are needed which might be helped the government to earn foreign currency. For instance, Bangladesh and the Philippines are two nations that send thousands of skilled workers in middle -east and other countries and around forty per cent of the revenues come from remittances. Hence, free higher studies will encourage individuals to study and a country can reserve foreign dollars. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, university graduation should be free to everyone, it is, therefore, I am convinced that this will make a nation wealthy and provide equality in learning.'",

I believe that this trend has happened because of the ways people balance between work and life and although busy professional activities provide us financial security, it takes the toll on an ideal family life where children might take the wrong path  living.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal reasons why all the members of a family are not sitting together at the supper table is because individuals have been working more than the normal working hours since the last few decades. As  time progress competitions are increasing tremendously and to survive human need to work harder than their ancestors. For example, in the past citizen's job hours were not more than six  a day but now they need to spend at least nine hours. Therefore, when the breadwinner comes  home , other members might be sleeping already and  it is difficult to find an hour for the family meal.\r\n\r\nHard work pays fortune and thus it is good for the financial stability of a family. When people wake up early before their children, they miss  breakfast and parents usually do this to fulfil the main necessities of the family member. However, offsprings need attention and care from their parents.  Fulfilling the demand is not everything that a parent should do, they should also need to spend some periods with their family members. Sometimes if a child does not get proper attention, they take the wrong route  such as  start smoking, drinking alcohol and even sometimes they take life-threatening drugs like afim and heroine. Hence, it is a moral obligation for every father and mother to speak frankly with children and the best place can be at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while parents a busy making money for the future of their offspring, they miss the precious time that can be easily achievable in an eating place and as a result of it, no child will take an evil road in life.'",

Although the freezing season produces different types of green vegetables which are beneficial for health, I personally believe that the summertime brings out the best of living because humans have emotions.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, winter is one of the best seasons when new vegetables and fruits grow tremendously. At this time healthy, leafy green vegetables  such as broccoli, cauliflower, beans, and carrots become cheaper and poor people can effort them easily. Hence, This reduces the risk of becoming malnourished for nations. For example, in Bangladesh, in the winter season, farmers grow potatoes, broccoli, lemons, carrots and tomatoes and the price is almost ninety per cent less compared to the market value in other seasons. However, I personally think that cold,foggy and hazy environments do not bring the bright side of the human mood.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, whilst in the summer season individuals suffer from extreme sweating and  use air conditioning, this time gives the best emotional state. On  bright sunny days individuals do not need to stay inside, they can work out outside and can have a family picnic somewhere on a lovely beach. For instance, it has been seen that the number of visitors to the world largest sea beach Cox's Bazar is higher just after the winter and it show that people love to break the monotonous life of the cold period.Therefore, I am convinced that everybody wants to move freely and become active with their family members on a beautiful hot blue sunny day.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a bright sunny day brings the best psychological sides of humans, while freezing haze produces healthy food and it is, thus, I choose hot weather to cold.'",

I would argue that they should be included in the process of teaching because of their benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I believe that there is a range of advantages in teaching through modern technologies. It could be explained that pupils can use laptops in order to search for useful information from appropriate websites, so they can broaden their knowledge as well as update materials quickly. To do that, teachers also need to guide students using it properly. Moreover, teachers may slideshow teaching contents through presentations on laptops or gadgets instead of traditional methods so that the lectures will become lively, attractive and make youngsters remember lessons better. For example, in Europe, many schools are required to install projectors, PC in the classroom and it is mandatory that students have to know how to use them in the studying process.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people think that technologies cause disadvantaged influences to pupils if we depend on them when teaching. It is because using computers regularly will lead to a sedentary lifestyle in the reality of youngsters, as a result, teenagers suffer from school diseases such as nearsightedness, obesity and isolation. For instance, case studies in the USA show that about 50% of pupils are having problems related to their eyes. In addition to learning purposes, students may spend a lot of time on online games without the control or using time balance by parents. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people state classrooms should be established with computers and the curriculum need to have teaching direction, others think that they can be certainly troubles for teenagers.

Above all, it represents the heritage culture of ancient folks. For instance, it can boost forceful bonding with  different communities. Furthermore, pupils can know about different organizations without travelling to a foreign land. Likely, it is vital to portray ancient art of the different regions. It can help particular land to generate revenue and that can be used in renovating museums and in the same way expanding them. \r\n\r\nSecondly, a union should ask for permission before displaying other regional arts in the museum. Also, this exchange will introduce diversity with the region itself, local people will get to explore the history and culture of another place without going to a particular state. For example, the European king was started to colonize throughout Asia and they used the opportunity and took crucial jewellery and historical documents with them. Moreover, some countries consider their arts as national treasures. That is, in a report recently released by WHO, London national museum has 90% of its arts originally from other regions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it would be beneficial for the country and their population to know about different heritage cultures of other countries.

While some people are of the view that teachers should not give home exercises for school kids, others are of the opinion that homework is very essential for youngsters. In this essay, I will be discussing both the views and state my opinion that homework is very important in the education of children. There are two primary reasons for this.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many reasons why school kids should be assigned  daily tasks. Firstly, teenagers nowadays are very occupied with entertainment such as playing video games, using social media to name a few. As a result of which they give less importance to studies. For instance, when teachers start giving day to day tasks, youths effectively utilize their time and complete the targets efficiently. Secondly, assignments aid in helping the students to understand the concepts clearly. Hence kids will practically learn the theoretical concepts by doing the small tasks at home.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many disadvantages in delegating children with an assignment as the younger generation find it very stressful. Additionally, they think it is too much burden on them to study not only in their university but also to revise the chapters at home. For example, a recent study done in India showed that youths who are not asked to complete the daily education task in their houses, feel very relaxed and concentrate on studies effectively. Subsequently, they find it less stressful.\r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, I reaffirm my position that although there are many drawbacks of assigning younger one's homework, it is very essential because it helps them in understanding the concepts better and utilizing their time effectively.'",

In other words, people are normally addicted to certain habits where allow them to sit for long hours without moving a single finger. Moreover, they may encounter severe health problems due to uncautious consumption hours for television. As reported in the Stay Fit magazine, the majority of obesity cases are originated from visual advertisements that incentivise consumers to eat frequently. Thus, there are various detrimental effects for seated life systems in front of a screen.\r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason to support my view is that digital channels embrace the notion of public separation. This means that each person creates a personal space that abandons relationships and social interactions with familiar surroundings. Furthermore, some media programs publish specific materials related to violence in order to favorise human isolation toward others. To demonstrate, my family possesses three televisions because every member generally prefers to see his private show instead of exercising group activities.

What are the effective ways to improve people's eating habits?' \n 'Text': 'In the modern world where convenience takes priority, more concerns are stemmed from people's consumerism of fast food. Even at the expense of health, people still opt for these unhealthy meals. This essay outlines some possible explanations for this phenomenon and gives out some ways to improve unwholesome eating practices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many factors lie that account for the general obsessive cravings. Scientific research has discovered that there is a high amount of sugar and saturated fat in these flavourful meals. For these elements, when we consume fast food, our brains generate chemicals stimulating a feeling of happiness and relaxation. Thus, constantly eating food is a way for our brain mechanism to seek pleasure. Moreover, these fat-laden food contains high calories counts so they provide lots of energy for a busy day. This convenience  has led many people with hectic schedules to choose fast food as their favourite meal. Therefore, despite being harmful, fast food is sought after in every meal of the day.\r\n\r\nIn terms of being healthy, there are some feasible ways to have a salutary eating habit. The crucial thing is substituting high calories food with low energy but a big portion. In order to make this process less painful, people are recommended to find a dish that shares a similar taste . For example, salted nuts and grains can replace crunchy, tasty fried chicken or brown rice with vegetables and sauce can be more delectable than fried rice. In addition to food choices, busy workers are also encouraged to choose eateries providing organic and healthy meals over fast food joints. By strictly adhering to carefully choosing your food, there will be a great enhancement in one's health and invigorates.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, unhealthy food is undoubtedly palatable because of the aforementioned reasons. However, by changing daily food choices, people can still enjoy the appetizing of dishes while improving their health.'",

Many claimes that this is one of the most essential things for economic growth ,however, some people opine that this could be dangerous for domestic products and industries. From my point of ,view, I completely believe that the close economic connection is dispensable for all countries around the world.\r\n\r\nFirstly , in my ,opinion, one of the conspicuous reasons for this argument is creating an economic relationship among all countries around the world. For example ,when each area exports its domestic goods to other regions around the globe this could cause countries are not required to produce all items for consumption. It means that all areas on the earth could fulfil the needs of each other and move this stuff to other districts without receiving money. This would create a space where countries could build good communication with each other. Therefore ,this makes it clear why most of the population claims this is necessary to conduct and this should be increased.\r\n\r\nBy contrast ,others believe that this could close our factories and cease to produce local goods. For instance ,when a particular country import all items that the society needs people do not accept to work in factories and workshops to produce local substances. This could create a dire situation for employers besides they regularly go bust in addition to losing money. As a result ,it becomes apparent this is a noticeable reason behind each claim via the community \r\n\r\nTo summarise ,I strongly believe that this trend would create a noteworthy interplay among all districts on the earth. It is predicted that to continue this trend the number of close relationships among areas will proceed to increase in the near future.'",

This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, local authorities should build more public expressways. In other words, more alternative roads are needed to respond the today's demand. 70% of wet lanes existing today in  Brazil were made 50 years ago, it is pointed out by the recent investigation done by the local press for instance. As a result, the number of cars has soared causing traffic congestion. Moreover, it is the prime reason for vehicles accidents in many nations throughout the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the shortfall in finances hinders roads renovation. Because of lack of financial resources the local ruling power does not extend the number of ways to suffice the demand. For example,  last year Florida University's investigation showcased that approximately four-fifths of the Africa government does not have money for street maintenance. Hence, the overwhelming majority of the local roads are lanes and bumpy resulting in a plethora of street issues.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding money issues being the overriding reason for lack of progress in a myriad of regions, the local cabinets should escalate public expressways and autobahns to tackle the problem.

Many  celebrities introduce commercial products and encourage people to follow them and purchase manufacturers.As a result, they do not show  their talent at these parts of their work.Additionally,youngers who like to be at this  level of wealth be confused about the right way of progressing .\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,teenagers who often have a favour to be famous try to make themself like celebrities.Consequently,they wear clothes and make up the same as their favourite actor or singer,therefore,these younger people will expose to some vulnerable results .we hear from news about youths who wanted to be famous unfortunately,they involved in  gang groups who are shown by some celebrities for benefits.Moreover, the celebrities should be aware fans to know their life story in order to promote their training and hardworking.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,seeing celebrities on the media is not their real life.It is unquestionable that  famous persons did lots of efforts to achieve their position but  they do not have a desire to express that to others.The teachers and parents need to educate their children to study celebrities achievements in addition to their income and appearance.'",

However, there are a lot of successful people who didn't get higher education.\\n\\nDo you think that higher education is necessary to succeed in life?' \n 'Text': 'Having  higher schooling from university   plays a brighter role in person future and this thing is popular currently in the world. But, there are countable successful people, who didn't get higher study. From my perspective higher education is as vital as anything else to be successful in life. And my position is argued further.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some groups of folk said that higher education is not important to be successful. In that case, if someone is popular in their fields doesn't mean they did all the hard work but there are some educated people who helped them to be in that position. For instance, the most popular platforms like Instagram or WhatsApp in that business there are engineers who designed codes to work properly in that application and even regular checking of the data and perfection which only maintained by IT technicians. Hence, they are successful in life but this is all because of people who did higher studies.\r\n\r\nBesides this, while having an idea doesn't mean anybody can make anything but for ,that you need to have skills and knowledge and that will be only achieved by higher study. For example, the Ubar cab maker does have an idea and they did start a smaller start-up through 20 cars but they provide their position to the engineer to run and grow that business while he stayed down for some time until  are they popular worldwide. So having knowledge and but for perfect implication is always comes from studies.\r\n\r\nThus to conclude that having higher education in the current time is much needed because having that skills and degree on your side means someone definitely feels your value even successful ones too.'",

In the other words, to avoid failure individuals should adopt the right skills and spend the necessary time for it. For instance, the recent investigation carried out by the University Zambeze last year showcased that solely the IELTS takers who followed their tutors' instructions and spent at least three hours on computer screen approved. As a result, a plethora of them was delighted and successful in their activities. Furthermore, it is pointed out as the prime reason for high approval in schools and Universities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the presence of God glosses over failure. Because of his ubiquity, no matter the time allocated and the abilities one has if he is out of God's protection the chance to be unsuccessful escalates. 40% of Universities students who devoted their time studying to exams with skilled tutors were reported not to be approved due to lack of connection with holy spirits for example. Hence, despite a lot of efforts they made, it was diminished to nill. Moreover, this is the overriding purpose for widespread prays in stadiums, hospitals, and before any activity goes on.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding the need for Jesus' blessing to one be well-succeeded, the hours' administration and the right capabilities proved to be the most pivotal Therefore, I still strongly disagree with the statement.'",

I strongly coincide with the former declaration, and this essay will hold the reasons for my view.  \r\n\r\nTo commence, leaving refugees, in rural areas, without any resources has numerous negative repercussions on national security. In other words, it would lead to major crime in the public because homeless people may attempt to steal essential merchandise from grocery stores in order to survive the day. Moreover, they could disturb tourists by demanding some financial assistance like money or clothing which will encroach their personal privacies. To demonstrate, I was visiting Istanbul last summer when certain destitute persons appeared in my way requesting a couple of dollars. Thus, countries that possess a number of deprived individuals is suffering from harmful effects on their safety.     \r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason to support my view is disadvantaged communities are very similar to other social groups. This means that retired employees and patients with special disabilities are being suitably treated by the government, however, they paid taxes or not. Furthermore, the majority of well-being are affected by ethics and moral values which motivate to reduce global poverty through charities and campaigns. As reported in UNICEF in 2020, one dollar per capita is sufficient to produce one meal which represents a fair cost to be contributed from each nation. Hence, deficient personals resemble every member of society.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, every human living without accommodation or financial support is under public responsibility.

I strongly oppose  the former declaration, and this essay will hold the reasons for my view.\r\n\r\nTo commence, leading a minor to an equivalent prison for adults has numerous negative repercussions on the generic development of a human.

Moreover, there are certain rules inside the jail that oblige prisoners to adjust their daily routines which will affect various physical aspects such as sleeping hours and though works. As reported in the Times magazine in 2015, a significant number of suicide cases under legal age has been registered in police records due to detrimental treatment inside penal institutions. Hence, the experience of balanced punishment facilities has proved harmful effects on the healthy involvements of a young individual. \r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason to support my view is that the mind of a juvenile did not attend a complete maturity in order to be convicted similarly to grown persons. This means that special tribunals are allocated for juniors. Additionally, numerous countries rely on rehabilitation centres because they believe that minors need  special care that will provide a second opportunity  for a prosperous future. To demonstrate, I had my relative who was addicted to drugs,however, the Canadian government procured required assistance which led him to the way of salvation. Thus, conviction is treated differently according to the mental level of each person.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people consider that crimes people must be evaluated identically among social groups.

I strongly agree with this statement because people follow celebrities and are motivated by  advertisements.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why individuals follow someone else's fashion is because those well-known individuals are their idols. Usually, Hollywood actors bring new  trend and their followers buy  similar design clothes. It is not only in the film industry but also in sports. For example, in every news media there was one particular topic when the world greatest footballer Mr Lionel Messi joined  the France football club Paris Saint Germain is how much profit PSG is going by selling Messi's kit. This is happened because of the personal image and charismatic skills of Messi. However, there are persons who still believe that comfort is the basis for  fashion and they do not run after any celebrity design.\r\n\r\nAnother reason I agree with this view is that most   people love advertisements.  It has been seen that  good advert attracts consumers and companies pay a high amount of money in promoting their goods. For instance, there was an incident in Bangladesh where  citizens saw advertisements regarding an online shopping platform named Evaly and its discounted offers. They  ordered and suffered due to the companies wrong business policy. Nonetheless, individuals need to know which products or offers are good instead of copying from the advert.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people love to mimic their celebrity idol's dresses, lifestyles and even if they buy products if these celebrities promote.'",

At the same time, there is concern about its impact on local inhabitants and the environment.\r\n\r\nDo the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the advantages?' \n 'Text': 'Connoisseurs throughout the earth have debated whether the benefits of  worldwide travel outweigh  its  pitfalls or not. Personally, I believe that the drawbacks do not outweigh the boons since it is the source of  revenues  for a wide variety of nations.  Although  it  has  its disadvantages. This essay will shed light on both sides of the matter and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, international touristry is a source of countries' incomes. In other words,  many  nations survive through it. The touristry industry contributed  10-15% of  PIB for 32 European, African , and American countries in the last 5 years, facts confirmed by the UN overhaul  made recently for instance. As a result,   individuals' social life enhanced and their economies have grown up. Moreover,  a significant  number of   the world-ruling power are creating  natural  beauty spots  to  rise tourism attraction in their lands.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the travelling industry brings human traffic. Because of  its straightforwardness  to connect  people  around the world,  a myriad of tourists deceives local citizens promising them employment and a high standard of life.  For example,  the recent investigation by UNICEF showcased that  one in ten commuters throughout the world   were involved in children traffic. Hence,  the local communities saw travellers as deceivers.  Furthermore,   it is the overriding reason for police  criminal records internationally.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding its downsides, international touristry  is the future of  the earth folk.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Recently, a societal issue related to commuting distance has been widely discussed among people the world over. Some argue that it brings negative effects while others disagree. As far as urbanization, economy and health are concerned, I strongly hold that the advantages of longer travel distances far outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, It is undeniable that longer travel length brings some disadvantages. For instance, individuals have to spend more time commuting. It does harm to the efficiency. In addition, longer length means more expenditure on commute. In the present society, there are many individuals who still suffer from chronic poverty. They cannot afford the commute cost so that they are hard to get appropriate jobs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, longer commute distance also has benefits to individuals and society. First of all, although the commute is extending, the cost would not increase too much because public traffic is  developing too. Secondly, with the development of urbanization, the environment of the city centre is gradually deteriorating. According to a recent survey, four million people die each year from diseases linked to environmental problems. Therefore, many people migrate to the countryside at expense of extending the commute time to living in a healthy environment. For example, my friend Yu Qian resident in the city centre who was diagnosed with cancer. He supposed that the terrible environment was the cause of his disease.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I suppose that longer travel distance has more advantages than disadvantages as long as resolving some problems such as traffic cost and commute time. Government should be well-advised to give priority to developing public traffic.'",

Furthermore,  they were responsible for the increased salary  inside these enterprises.  As a result, workers' social life was enhanced and communities were delighted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the desire to learn new duties and the capabilities to make others  laugh was the source of the community staff unit.

For example, it was noticed by a sociologist that in neighbourhoods where several swimming pools and basketball fields were available, the inhabitants of those areas contracted fewer heart failures, and pupils were less obese .\r\n\r\nHowever, the aforementioned reasons will only lead to scant results. Indeed, the Coronavirus pandemic we have been suffering from the last 2 years have proved that our care organization suffers a huge shortage in terms of hospital beds and public infrastructure in general.

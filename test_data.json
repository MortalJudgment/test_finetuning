Most noticeably, the elimination of the farmland. \r\n\r\nLooking at the picture in detail, one can see that the farmland in the northeastern corner was turned into a large entertainment complex with a swimming pool, a hotel, and two tennis courts. The fish market, the marine, and the pier system were completely demolished to make way for a private beach. \r\n\r\nTurning to the southwest of the map, many wind turbines were erected facing the sea. Besides, the cafe in the centre of the beach was still in the same place, while a new parking lot was added next to the hotel to better cater to the accommodation needs of visitors.'",

While some individuals perceive this as an ideal method of managing a business, others consider that it has several difficulties. In the essay, we will examine both perspectives and argue that while family ownership has its benefits, it may lead to inherent problems that can hinder sustainable business growth.\r\n\r\nMany people hold the view that the strong sense of unity and loyalty are the major advantages of running a family business. Family members working together tend to share a deep bond and commitment to the success of the business. This bond can create a wonderful environment for efficient decision-making and effective communication for the future. For example, some family-run companies has maintained their reputation for decades due to family\u2019s strong dedication to quality and customer satisfaction. Their customer services have earned them a loyal clientele.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is argued by some that the family-run business is not always successful as there are many disputes. This can create ego related some issues and ruin in the family peace. Some family members especially youngsters are willing to join this trade because they want to earn more money so this will create a detrimental impact on the company.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, a family-owned business which has commitment and good relationship will improve for a long time. However, the family who tries to run their own business have to keep their bonds before they turn into a business crisis.'",

In Korea, some people cannot go to the university that they wish because mostly excellent university located our capital city. So they choose other cities' universities cause of they cannot bear the expenses such as housing and tution fees. Last but not least, country development is followed by education. Because, school can make their student as a specialisit in promising fields such as IT and medicine.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the above-mentioned issues, some people assert that student need not any subsidy for their university study. The main disadvantage is that some students do not want to graducate their university. For example, in Gernamy, they already practice this policy however, few people do not graudate because the school benefits are massive. As a result, it can leads to waste tax.

To be honest, I share a different opinion.\r\n\r\n    I regard we have to admit that, vehicles which use fuel did influnced our evirnoment a lot, and it is a good way to impose tax on those drivers. The action of add tax maybe can reduce some emission from those vehicles, but I have to say the effect will be limited.\r\n\r\n    For one thing,if  the tax policy was acted, it will lower the life quality of  working class people while the rich people won't feel much difference. The users of fuel powered vehicles a lot are usually whealthy people, especially those who drives cars like landrovers and fancy race cars, these cars bruns way more fuel per meils than ordinary cars. For working class people, they won't need a tax to make them change their old car to elechronic cars. So that, tax on fuel powered vehicles might not be very useful.\r\n\r\n   One thing for another, if government dose imposed the tax, the question to be asked is what will government do with the income. Government held elections every 4 or 5 years in most of countries. It usually takes years to pass the law about the tax, and tax on every fuel powered car driver for 1 or 2 years, then they hold a relection, new government maybe the axe the tax, because the citizens elect them for that. After all these, those tax money will be used on other things.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, to reduce the traditional vehicles users the best way is not to add tax on them. There are many other ways like developing new cars use electricity and let people know about our environment via news or education.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, housing crisis have emerged as one of the most pressing challenges in urban areas around the world. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and increasing economic disparities have contributed to a shortage of affordable housing, skyrocketing rents, and homelessness. \r\n\r\nOne of the primary causes of the housing crisis in cities is the imbalance between supply and demand. Many cities are facing a significant mismatch between the supply of housing and the increasing demand due to factors such as limitied land avilability, strict zoning regulations, and slow construction processes. Additionally, income inequality is another factor contributing to the housing crisis. Rising income disparities exaberate the situation, making it increasingly difficult for low-income indivisuals and families to afford suitable housing options. \r\n\r\nAddressing the housing crisis requires comprehensive and innovative solutions. I will suggest some strategies for tackling them. First, cities can implement affordable housing programs that provide subsidies, incentives, or partnerships with developers to increase the avilability of affordable housing units. This can be achieved through government fundings, tax breaks, or regulations that mandate a certain percentage of affordable units in new developments. \r\n\r\nAside from that, cities can review and update their zoining regulations to allow for higher-density development, mixed-used neighborhoods, and inclusiory zoining. Inclusionary zoining mandates a certain percentage of affordable housing in new developments, ensuring that socioeconomic diversity is maintained as neighborhoods evolve.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, people have to pay attention to the change of economic policies of a country and government should make a effort for solving problems consistantly. these methods can alleviate problems of a housing shortage and can make the society more inclusive, equitable and thriving.'",

In bachelor\u2019s degree, students can not experience deep dive to certain major because of its wide range of field. Personally, bachelor\u2019s degree aims to find a course that encourages students, and those who want to study more would consider Master\u2019s degree and study deeper. Moreover, having various experience in multiple major could help finding a job more easily, enables applying more wide range of fields.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are pros and cons in both area, thus I personally think having more multiple major could be better. In modern society which artificial intelligent is improving rapidly, having just single knowledge could be dangerous, because it is easy to alternate. Combining multiple fields enables finding a great insight, which is the key of competitive among the other applicants. Therefore, I find more than one major could be better.'",

Some people believe that this is because women are able to earn and therefore do not require financial security that marriage can bring. To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'In the past, women were accustomed to marry once they reach a certain age. However, in the contemporary society, ladies tend to refrain from marriage and prefer living by themseleves. Many believe the reason behind this change as women being financially independent in the present world. According to my perspective in addition to the aforementioned fact, there are several reasons behind this phenomenon. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will elaborate on this in more detail.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, back in the days men were breadwinners and females were housewives in an ordianry family. Hence, females used to solely rely on their husbands for financial support. In other words marriage was essential for women to survive. However, with the change of time more females choose to pursue higher education and choose a career path. This provided financial freedom and an independent lifestyle. Therefore, marriage has become an option.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to the independent life style society started valuing equality among men and women. Many became feminists. And started to believe that a women's main job is not upbring children and taking care of a family. Thus, emotional freedom and well being also became an important aspects of life. For instance, ladies started following their dreams like travelling around the world, exploring new adventures and living a free life without any family responsibility. Moreover, some women cannot accomodate taking care of a child with their busy life styles and other life goals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, females choose single lives mainly because they can earn money. In addition, there are numerous reasons why women choose not to marry. However, this lead the society to view marriage in a different perspective.'",

This is mainly due to huge appitite to eat but they cannot complete the whole portion that they ordered.

Generally, in many places people orders more than three items in the menu. Although, they cannot finish all the dishes that they orderd but people want to experinces the taste of the dish. Moreover, the left overs cannot be taken home because they spoil quickly. Therefore, people throw the remaining food, causes food wastage. For example, recent studies in India shows that 60% of the food wastage is due to the people ordering more number of items than their hunger. \r\n\r\nOne of the possible solution for this issue to give awarness to the public. There are plenty problems associated with soplied food this such as pollution, increase in insets and deseases. However, many individuals are not aware of these problems. In every food place there should be an advertisment of these problems. Government should allocate funds and run social campaines.

What are the causes and solutions?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays more people tend to behave antisocially and there is a decline in respect for other people. There could be several reasons for that.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of the current increase in anti-social behaviour might be rooted in the ubiquious technological development, which has resulted in the decline in personal communication and the rise of human-machine interaction. Thus, we tend to interact more with the software than with human beings resulting in more antisocial actions. This problem might be solved by promoting the idea of interpersonal activities, communities and interest based clubs, which could encourage kinder and more amicable behavour. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for the lack of respect in everyday situations could be possibly that of the shortage of attention paid to the development of soft skills and emotional intelligence at schools. So, when graduates enter the fast paced productivity-oriented work environment they find themselves lacking empathy and ethical behavior, which not only hinders communication, but also results in smaller productivity. This can be solved early by implementing emotional intelligence classes in compulsory education at schools.\r\n\r\nFinally, the lack of mutual respect can also be rooted in the modern trend for assertiveness and brutality, which are oftentimes overestimated and promoted on social media. The cases of anti-social behavior have often been mistakenly shown as 'cool', which has led to more young people devaluating basic human virtues. The only possible solution to this can be in more spotlight hogged by the idea that kindness and respect are foundations for the successful life and traits of a strong personality.\r\n\r\nOverall, the issue of anti-social behaviour and the lack of mutual respect is quite acute, however there are a few solutions that could tackle it.'",

Others think that it is better to work for different organisations.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both therse views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporaries times, the majority of employees intend to work for fixed corporations, while others assert that it is better to change jobs if needed. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favor for the latter notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why individuals who insist on being loyal workers could be advantageous to a certain extent. First and foremost, it could guarantee the stability of staffs' lives. For example, besides their basic salaries, experienced employees could receive additional bonuses as a tribute to their dedication, which could help them easily cover their daily costs, such as accommodation, food, and bills. Furthermore, taking part in only one firm could support workers have successful career paths. This is because without worrying about financial burden, members of the company could focus on studying a particular field more deeply, thereby leading them to become professional experts but also taking on higher positions in the firms.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that altering different organisations could have significant benefits. One rationale is that it could improve jobholders' wages. In fact, they are likely to be paid higher than their current payments when they change jobs, thus, this is an opportunity to raise their incomes as well as the quality of their lives. Another justification is that new workplaces could provide a better developing environment. To be more specific, jobholders could find suitable company that adapt their aims, such as broadening experiences, learning relevant job skills, and creating networking, which could play a role as motivators and satisfactory to encourage staffs to work more efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that staying in the same enterprise for the whole life brings numerous valuable results, I would contend that entering alternative organisations is more beneficial.'",

To explicate, the individuals requir a lot of time to learn about and explore the outside world in their young age. Further, the life skills like communication and other interpersonal skills are inculcated in this age. This knowledge is very important for the overall growth of an individual as it would be necessary for them to communicate and coordinate with others. It could be said that as a rose blossoms only when it remains untouched and unharmed, so is the case of young individuals. Hence, they could not be burdened with other responsibilities. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it is crucial to consider that the community works could develop a sense of oneness among the teenagers who participate in them. Adding to it, there are many opportunities that the youngsters get when they participate in the community work.

For instance, recent studies prove that the number of students who suffer from depression have increased from 30% to 50% during the last five years. In my university, for example, there are a large number of students who are stopping from attendance to class and prefer to start their job because of the enormous of Responsibilities and challenges they have faced during their studies. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of people argue that puplis all over the world must learn under pressure to learn effectively.

Although government should invest to builr more museums, people should contribute to organisations especially museums which aggrandize people's education about their ancestors, In addition, museums should have fee and people mabe damage historical items.

I am of the view that a language should be one of the first subject to be taught in the early years and to be perfected as the years of learning progresses.\r\n\r\nA language can be one of the most difficult subjects that a student could come across as it might be foreign to them. If one does not use that particular language in their day to day, they  will need more time to understand the basics and then get used to it for them to be fluent hence the need to start early on. One can also argue that other subjects like mathematics, history, geography and so many others are usually taught in English in many countries all over the world so there is need to begin with English language amongst other languages so that students can immensely understand all those other subjects.\r\n\r\nHowever, a language can be introduced in the later years of learning. This is so because there is a need to understand basics of learning which is acquired when one fully understands other subjects which are basics like writing and reading. A student will have to learn how to read and write the things they fully understand before being introduced to more complex subjects such as languages.\r\n\r\nI could argue that younger the better when it comes to fully grasping the complexity of a language. When the years of learning progresses one will therefore be able to speak, read and write if only they started to learn early.'",

There can be many reasons of this and people may have varied opinions on the topic. However, my own perspective is uttered as under. The modern era brought a plethora of positive and negative changes that were needed. Although, the reasons for the said happening are not that simple. One of the reasons could be that after giving birth, the women are fed up of their schedule. So in order to have a change in their daily life, they opt for a job and as the baby is needed to be looked after, it is done by the male patent. The other reason may be the wave of feminism that is breaking the patriarchy and consolidating a novel matriarchy. Moving to the positive side, if the fathers are staying at home then the mother is relieved of the daily chores and it is also necessary for their proper recovery from the traumas that they might have experienced during the painful days. Apart from that, it is also beneficial on the global scale as development of a country is judged from the independence enjoyed by the females. Turning to the negative aspect, there might be some conflicts that may arise between the parents because the men are not as gentle as the women in dealing with the children. The prolonged harsh treatment to a child may result in improper growth of a kid.

It is my contention that although there are a numerous objectives listed on the agenda of the field of science to be implemented, improvement of people's live should be prioritized with the upmost significance.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, undoubtedly, it is almost impossible to envision the future of humanity in the event that the science is devoid. This is primarily due to the life-altering inventions that invented through the scientific researches and investigations. As we live on the edge of technology, making humanity a multiplanetary specie is considered the cornerstone achievement in history which has not been realized yet. It goes without saying that with the help of distinctive scientific subjects such as rocket engineering and material strength, a slow but determined step is taken each day, taking us  one step closer to our end goal. To exemplify this statement, space companies like NASA and Space X invest billions of dollars into the research and development activities to advance the rocket technology and ultimately one day carrying humanity to another planet and terraforming it. \r\n\r\nMoreover, it is also worth noting that science's footprint in the field of medicine and pharmacy is paramount, therefore, modern scientists should put all their efforts to find solutions to cure terminal illnesses.

In my stance, the world lives in harmony is greatly positive and contributional to society. I will outline my viewpoint and reasons in the essay below.\r\n\r\nThe most significant basis why globalisation is a positive development for humanity is because it is profitable for the international and national economy. Through the means of technology and trades, products can be exported and consumed widely, creating an active economy climate through which nations can learn from each other. Owing to this trading network, countries across the world can cultivate their own economy by cooperating with other countries, indirectly improving the living condition of the people. For instances, Asian countries export their agricultural products to Western countries, therefore, the farmers can create more consumption market and also promote their own cultures to the foreign.\r\n\r\nAnother advantageous attribute of globalisation is in the social respect. When many individuals from different regions use the same social platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok, knowledge and experience can be disseminated globally and become known by others. Users can exchange their cultural differences and establish bonds with one another. In the big picture, this can promote the beauty of each cultures to international friends and further strengthen the relationships between nations, eradicating discrimination and inequalities.\r\n\r\nGranted, there are still some downsides of globalisation that cannot be neglected. One of them are environment pollution. As the economic race is becoming more compeititive between big international corporations, a negative trend arise to benefits their budget which is race-to-the-bottom. This trend exerts adversed effects on the evironment and is gradually destroying the ecosystem.

Give your opinion and example.' \n 'Text': 'In several regions, it seems to be a challenge for over 50-year-old individuals to seek for appropriate work positions in spite of their noticeable experience. There is a wide range of reasons for this kind of phenomenon as well as a number of solutions to improve the situation. This essay will analyze and discuss such practices along with my own perspectives. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, people who are older than 50 years old typically approach the retirement, which also means that they are hardly able to sign long term contract. For example, the age of superannuation in Vietnam is 55 and 60 regarding to women and men respectively. Therefore, they will have only a few years left until the moment they resign so it will be a waste of time as well as resources in training for them. If they are more than that age, they will be unable to dedicate fully to the companies owning to the lack of flexibility of variable working environments. In addition, the older they become, the more responsibility they have to take on in term of family. Hence, this kind of applicants seems to be incapable of committing thoroughly themselves to the job. \r\n\r\nSecond of all, increasing in age level also leads to a plethora of health issues. While younger generation is supposed to be more active and self-motivated to engage in divergent assignments, the former ones depend a lot upon health situation. Seldom do they involve in the night shifts or work overtime. Moreover, they find it extremely challenging to learn innovative technology to keep up with the youth. As a result, participating in a team with other members will then shape them in the prejudice of underwhelmed productivity. This can lead to potential conflict among fellow colleagues in case they are unable to maintain professional integrity under stressful condition. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a plenty of solutions which can be taken into consideration to address this issue. It has to be based on not only the intervention of the government but also the self-effort of the people who are more than 50 years old. For instance, the authority can modify the current law of salary and bonus regime for experienced people, especially for experts. Furthermore, senior employees who consider themselves to be potentially laid-off ought to stay updated with the novel application of science and technology by taking part in workshops to further improve their value which help remain their current positions. Besides, they should both put more effort into enhancing physical health and balance their personal life versus their career so as to meet the demand of multitasks. I strongly have a thought that with obvious determination, great attempt along with perseverance will finally end up with desired success. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to comprehend the problem of old people seeking for good jobs, yet there are a number of solutions to solve it as well. It requires a lot of endeavor from both candidates and the interference of the government so that we can enhance the situation.'",

Some segments of society strongly argue that masses mostly stuck in the traffic on the roads and waste their precious time in metro cities.This essay intends to cast light on the contributing factors and remedial measures to put a halt to it.Further, I will explicate about this matter in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo embark with, a host of reasons can be attributed to this phenomenon. Colossal reason is the worse condition of the roads. To elaborate this, in this cutting-edge, the roads are not accurately maintained. Thus, folks do not drive properly but also bad incidents happens which leads to death. Moreover, inhabitats prefer to use private vehicles. To justify this, in the modern epoch, individuals commute through their own transportation instead of public way of transport. Ultimately, the traffic congestion has been significantly incline. To cite an example, a recent article in a prestigious newspaper highlighted that due to heavy traffic, 85% of workers did not reach at work on time because the citizens faced traffic problem on regular basis.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as every problem has their own curative measures. Foremost is that, funds should be allocated on maintance for the roads. To substantiate this, the national authorities should spend money on the streets for care or they should construct new bridges or roads for alleviate this issue. Besides this, the car pooling policy should be used by the public. Hence, this would be mitigate major obstacles such as traffic, air pollution etcetra. To exemplify, in 2019, a awareness campaign organized by renowned University in which youth provided awarness regarding car pooling policy which proved helpful.  \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, unquestionably, this problem has become a burning question of the day.Therefore, it is not an easy task to solve this. Regimen and society should come forward to diminish this complex issue.'",

However, others assert that there are diverse factors that bring to people happiness without kids. In this essay, I will explain why people who don't have their kids can feel happy and propose diverse ideas in people's lives affect happiness.\r\n\r\nThere are surely a few reasons why we can live it up without their sons and daughters. First and foremost, a main reason is that they can save a lot of money and they can expenditure their money on hobbies. For example, in Korea, they need a lot of money if they want to raise kids because of education fee, hospital charges, and clothes are expensive. In contrast, if they don't have kids they can learn whatever they want to learn such as sports, and arts, and even they can raise pets. Secondly, another reasonable one is that parents need not  argue about parenting problems for instance different ways of discipline,  education ways, and eating habits. Because, they are raised by different environments  they have diverse ideas when raising kids.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the above-mentioned content, there are various factors that make their lives happy. Firstly, raising pets such as dogs, cats, and parrots is one of the best ways to spend their time full of humour. For example, sometimes when I go to the park, I can see a dog and my grandmother and at that time, the owner says to me dog is better than the person because the dog obeys owner\u2019s requirements. Moreover, sometimes their residence makes people happy and comfortable. For example, in my case, whenever I return to my flat after my daily routine, I feel comfortable and thrilled.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, considering all the previously mentioned information even though having children has positive effects on theirs lives, however, I believe that we can fulfil our life happy with other ways.'",

The acquisition of english language skills are more pivotal than that of local languages. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and explain why I consider both are equily significant,\r\n\r\nEnglish has been occupied the top spot of most spoken language, without certain extent of ability to speak english, it is in fact relatively difficult to reach higher level of achievement in my opinion. Meanwhile, lacking english skills can also results in reduction of opportunity, because almost every apsect in this society, being able to communicate in english is a huge bonus point, sometimes even being an unskippable requirement. Thus, if individuals do not have adequate skills of english, they will face challenges, such as rejections from universities and companies they have always aspired to get into.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is also crucial to learn local languages, as they contain the culture and history meaning behind it. Simultaneously, language is also one of th building blocks of its culture characteristic. If individuals tend to soley focus on studying english for a better opportunity to connect to other parts of the world, the discrepancy between every unique culture and language itself are possible to diminsih ultimately. Therefore, some measures should be executed. To provide an example, local languages courses are mandatory here in Taiwanese educational settings. In addition, from the beginning of one's school life, you have to study Madarin thoroughly, even the literature works and cultural value it contains. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion. I acknowlege how crucial it is to have the ability to commuciate in English in this globalizing era, preserving and recognizing the value that local languages possess are also essential.'",

Advocates contend that inventions like the computer and television would be more helpful for making our lives more efficient and easygoing.

For example, we can use the apps to calculate our heart rate. Moreover, some apps would be useful when we face emergency situations by calling the police or hospital. \r\n\r\nHowever, working out our bodies is a crucial factor in maintaining our health. Sweating from our bodies can give us more energy and relieve our stress from the workplace. Since our body is not a machine, we should keep it moving and get adequate rest. Adolescents, including children, should exercise more than adults.

There are both merits and demerits, and I think the drawbacks are greater than the benefits. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several benefits of animal testing. First of all, animal testing is playing an increasingly important role in the field of medical industry. When researchers who majored in medical area find out new medicines of diseases, it has to be checked and tested. By using animals for testing, they can get various results such as side effects, validations and more, leading to the improvement of not only medical field but also human life. In addition, it is inevitable to use animals for testing instead of people. When scientists want to do test of their findings, it is hard for them to find individuals who want to participate in the experiment and it costs a lot. However, if they use animals, it is easy to find and spends much less. Therefore, there is no choice for them to use animal species for a test. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that the drawbacks outweighs the benefits, and there are some reasons of experimentation on animals. Firstly, the awareness of animal rights can be decreased. If people deem animals solely as a means of testing, animal\u2019s rights will be disappeared gradually. Human and animals must coexist together on earth, so people should preserve animal species, respecting their values. Moreover, experimentation on animals can exert a negative influence on human life. If researchers or scientists keep doing a test with animals, it will lead to the reduction of animal species. It is undeniable that animals play a crucial role in nature. Protecting animals is one of the effective solutions for preserving the natural environment, so it is imperative for individuals and society to stop animal testing. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that experimentation on animals is beneficial for the development of various fields. Nevertheless, people should protect and respect animals due to the responsibility, leading to the improvement of human life and the environment eventually. Therefore, governments or authorities worldwide should come into force a law associated with animal testing.'",

Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed?' \n 'Text': 'It is a fact that female students are more inclined towards the arts namely languages while boys get allured by the sciences such as physics. As per my viewpoint it is the case in majority of subject choices due to societal pressures. However, this has to be changed in the future.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, interplay of society and family roles play a big role in the decison for careers. Women usually find that they have to play the role of a mother and educate their children and also they are required to pay more attention to the household chores. Hence, arts seems to be less challenging and it has less job prospects. The families preach this ideology that they have to take dual responsibilities so they try to minimize their career impact from the beginning. However, in the case of men, it is thought that they might make their career better in the engineering field by taking physics and they can excel in such subjects due to minimal pressure from parents to participate in household responsibilities. Thus, this might be the reason for such decisions to opt the professions.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it should be changed. The contenders argue that this has detrimental effect on the society as a whole. A female is a would be mother that is the first teacher of her offsprings. If she does  not has any knowledge about science then how will she impart this to her kids? For example, some studies suggest that upbringing is the most the important step in the development of intersts in certain subjects which will determine the subjects children takes in the future.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is widely witnessed that gender biases are practiced to decide careers among people.

Nowadays, with the help on telephones and internet, a person can talk to his friend or relative sitting in another country, however, it was not possible in 20th century. It not only helped to reduce the distance but also helped to make relationship stronger. Nevertheless, I agree that people are more busy on phones, whether in scrolling instagram, watching movies or other stuff like that, but the culprit behind this not phone, it's the individual who is using it.  He should reduce the time he usually spend on these gadgets, so that he can enjoy more with his family.\r\n\r\n    Moving further, another cause of less interaction is busy life.  There is big race going on in outside world and everyone wants to win it. Therefore, no one has leisure time for his love ones.

They are running behind making more money and getting successful and because of all this, they are leaving behind their relationships.\r\n\r\n  To conclude, yes, at some extent mobile phones are the cause of less face to face communication but it also depends on the person how he use it.

Therefore, some poeple think that the government should increase spending on defense but spend less on social benefits. To what extent do you agree ?' \n 'Text': 'There is an ongoing debate about whether governments ought to prevent their population due to their responsibility by reducing social activities in public. Therefore, some people advocate that they do not have to lessen leisure activities in public in order to protect the crowd, yet others are no of strong belief about that matter. This essay strongly agrees with the opinion and considers that lessening activities is necessary to conserve people.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, plenty of issues in crowded places can be observed due to density of individuals. Which are namely infection, and disorders. In other words, administrations must restrict motion of humans in public in order to reduce viruses infecting over the air. For instance, proportion of illnes people was decreased by strict rules during the Corona-19 epidemic. Hence, carrying out limits in locals is significant so as to prevent public from diseases.\r\n\r\nNeverthless, in contemporary times, a myriad of countries  have struggled with terrorism issues. In addition, terrorists aim crowded places in order to properly implement their duties so a multitude of instructions, including prohibiting exhibitions or concerts, are being taken in order to guarantee population's life. For example, in 2017, a bomb attack in Turkey did not lead to huge issues since the governement had already applied ways preventing public. Thus, amending activities, such as concerts and festivals is fundamental to conserve crowd.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, restriction individuals' motions might firstly seem like a detrimental fact, yet it is extremely beneficial for public.

Due to children can learn this at home. I totally disagree with this statement. Indeed, the academic schooling is what opens the doors to different universities and helps to achieve goals and dreams, we should not forget about the clout of household proficiency, which the majority use every day.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the knowledge of the basic practical skills is simply essential. It helps not only in everyday life, but it also gives an opportunity for students to chose their own path in the future. Only by learning such dexterity, kids are able to make a decision, either way they would like to become a cook, carpenter or to have completely contrasting career. Of course, it doesn't guarantee that everyone will decide instantly, but it will definitely simplify the\r\n\r\npick.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is that not all of the students came from skilled worker's families.

In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensave the survival of local languages and if so, how?' \n 'Text': 'English become the worldwide language in modern world. In all over the world, people speaks the English language. Moreover, English in schools often see teach to students rather their native language but if students not learned their mother tongs it can dying out. In my point of view, native languages should give preference in school by organizing the competition events and writting the slogans on walls.\r\n\r\nTo commence with first view, English is vital to teach in school because it is the main language of most developed nation. If students learn English in early ages, they can go abroad for study and face less difficulties in language barriers and they have more opperunities in different sectors. For example, a survey shows by CBC 75 percent people are English language speaker. Hence, learn english language makes easy to survive in developed countries.\r\n\r\nMoving towards my opinion, school needs to organize competition and writes the slogan on walls for survival of nation language. Firstly, schools need to create interest to speak native language and needs to organize competition on school level, state level and nation level and give some prize on winning.This will create the interest in students to learn more about local language. Moreover, schools and government need to write. The slogan on school walls in native language so students can read when they see and government need to put sign board in thier local language so it will not diminish. For instance, Kerala start putting the raid and village name sign in local language along with English. Therefore, competition enhance the interest in students and slogan helps to preserve the native languages. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, learning a English is not bag because it is worldwide language but school and government to take necessary step to preserve the native languages by creating the interest in students as well as writting on the walls.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion' \n 'Text': 'In this day and age, noone can deny that our demand in term of traveling is one of natural demand of human and the evolution of low-cost airlines accommodate and let people with travel around the world more easier. Someone believe that the advantages of this innovation while the others prefer to think that low-cost airlines bring about lots of damaging effects.It is important to admit that both views have their own benefits. In this essay, I will discuss the possible reasons that support each view and what benefits they bring to the society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the option to think that the pros of cheap airlines has its benefits for many convincing reasons. Most importantly, one positive of this development is the increased of travel in all walks of lives. For example, in the past traveling by air was mainly reserved for rich people, however, low-cost airlines offer more reasonable price for airing travel to go on vacation domestically or to foreign countries. Furthermore, it is also important to mention that it contributes more income for the tourism industry and globalization process. For instance, in Thailand where the government focuses a lot on the tourism industry, flights are considered to be cheaper as compared to other countries lead to more and more traveller come here and this is an attempt to attract tourists easily and boost the country's economy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of that, I contend that low-cost airlines are a negative growth. One of the drawback of cheap airlines expansion is the a release of carbon emission which released from using fossil fuels ( coal, gas, petro\u2026). Consequently, if there are numerous of people travel by planes because of the cheaper price, the gas emission will be pile up in the atmosphere and destroy the earth\u2019s ozone layer. Additionally, this is one of the most reasons responsible for greenhouse gas and global warming. Another key reason is the low-cost airplanes is the main reason that bring about economic slowdown in other types of transportation. Cheap airplane bring to user the most service in everything ( saving time, better service,\u2026.) while the others can\u2019t do that. For instance, low-cost airplanes can take you 10 times faster than a ship or a train do while the tickets get a similar price or it\u2019s service will be better than the others transportation many times. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a cheap plane ticket has its benefits and drawbacks. Even though low-cost airline has its positive effect but it just the immediate benefits and natural and ourself have to suffer many consequences later, i believe that there are more negative impact of low-cost airlines so we need to g\u00ec \u0111\u00f3 con kbiet vi\u1ebft g\u00ec n\u1eefaaaaaaa'",

Some  dishonest government officials give more chances to wealthy men than destitute people.

Consequently, rich people are becoming richer and richer due to their various possibilities, meanwhile almost 70% of the total population live under the lowest level of standard of living.\r\n\r\nThe solution is how corruption can be eliminated in country is implementing custodial strict laws by arresting guilty people till the rest of their life or executing them. When any government representative is suspicious of being offered corrupted actions, responsible officers must take pro-active approaches to prove and punish that disloyal state worker.

By examining the method of communication between the past generations this method has proliferated the company to provide and upgrade their devices. People from anywhere in the part of the world can communicate virtually. For example, applications like whatsapp, instagram and skype plays a prominent role in this generation.

First and foremost, it is extremely time consuming as children find themselves scrolling down for hours rather than focusing on extracurricular activities or playing outdoor games with their counterparts. With the excessive use, people can become isolated and finds difficulty in communicating in academic or even with neighbourhoods.

What chould be done to reduce sugary drink consumption?' \n 'Text': 'The trend to drink sugar-based products has rose in the past few years. One of salient reason behind this trend is the rising proportion of stressful events across the worlds. However, it can be tackled with the firm actions from governments, which will be discussed in this essay. \r\n\r\nThe primary reason for this phenomena is the high prevalence of stressful events. It can be seen that several phenomena in this world lately has caused remarkable and detrimental impacts in society, such as the climate change and world war, which later intrigue them to experience psychological difficulties, mainly stress. Retrieved from Statista this month, the data reveals that there are 89% people globally who currently suffer from trauma and stress, prompting action to seek for coping strategies, such as travelling or consuming things that can help people to ease their feelings, and one of those is the consumption of sugar-based drink products. The extended study show, that since the beginning of climate change and Ukraine war in 2021, the proportion of people who consumed sugar-based drink has soared to 54% globally that has been indicated from the surging purchasement of several renowned products such as Coca Cola or Starbucks. Those people believe that the regular consumption of those products can significantly make them happier and less worried about future, as nowadays people likely to feel uncertain about it due to the world\u2019s unstable conditions. As a result, the prevalence from this condition can heighten the likelihood to suffer from some diseases such as diabetes or stroke; therefore the authorities are deemed to take actions. \r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the intake of sugar-based drinks, governments can start conduct some actions. First, increasing the price of sugar-based beverages. By rising the price, people will less likely to buy the product, since they it prompts a particular thought that people will waste their money. This radical solution has seen effective among Japanese citizens since their municipalities decide to culminate the price of sugar beverages in every restaurants and retailers by $2 until $5, eventually driving people to drink water instead. Second, subsidise a healthier drink option to substitute sugar-based drinks. For example, it can be seen in some Singapore streets where locals or tourists can easily find the fresh juice maker machine as part of the local government endeavours to reduce the percentage of people who suffer from diabetes due to their regular consumption of sugar-based drinks. From those solutions, it can be said that some firm actions by governments can effectively lower the proportion of people who consume sugar-based products. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the high number of sugar-based drink consumers is notably intrigued by the peak number of stressful events that currently happen across the world, as they begin to see that habit as one of effective coping strategies. To reduce that number; therefore, local municipalities can start to take actions such as increasing the price of sugary products and allocate more funds to a healthier beverage option in order to substitute the sugary products.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Undoubtedly, with the increasing numbers of individuals who pay more attention to the improvement and convenience of science and technology, people have started to neglect the importance of art. Hence, some people harbour a belief that authorities should not spend too much funding to develop the artistic realm. From my perspective, it is a very controversial issue which deserves a in-depth discussion, and a conclusion will be drawn.\r\n\r\nTo begin with,  art plays a vital role in our daily life. Admittedly, there is a growing tendency that people nowadays to either participate in art exhibitions, or join music concerts as a way of fostering relationships with family and friends during the weekend. Moreover, art projects are an effective and achievable solution to relieve the pressure from work and study. According to a study conducted by National Taiwan University, 80 percent of middle-aged adults reflected that having positive and constructive thoughts after participating in art activities.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Artworks effectively and unexpectedly shrink the gap and promote more interactions between countries. For instance, BTS, a Korean K-pop group, was extremely popular among millennials and invited to give a speech encouraging teenagers to love themselves at the United Nations. Music demonstrates that it can connect thousands of people across language barriers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though artworks do not directly affect improving people's lives, their merits must not be ignored by governments due to the function of connecting relationships and the benefits that shrinking the country's barriers.'",

As, these practioners are always demanded by common people for daily purposes due to connection with basic needs of health service, home buiding and common legal matters. For instance, developing countries like canada has shortage of employees in heath and construction sector which creates need to bring skilled engineers ansd doctors from other countries. Secondly, parents are extremly protective about their pears so they want them to work in these secure jobs. because, these are mostly 9 to 5 works with holidays on weekends which allows the employee to go home at night and enjoy weekends with families.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are several drawbacks of such kind of career related suggestions by parents. Firstly, it provokes the children to think of other creative works related to art, music ,sports and so on. As, these talents are need to be polished at little age to get huge succes in same field but conventional mindset of parents does allow children to think out of box.

There is a statement that some newspapers or books will not be used because people can read everything online without spending money. I personally disagree with this statement for strong reasons.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, not everyone can afford themselves to buy phones, because they cost more expensive than books or newspapers. It is more comfortable for people to buy a newspaper and read the news of the day, than buy a telephone, which cannot be used forever.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is health issues that new technologies usually cause. In this case it refers to our eye-sight. We know that the phones which we use every day has rays. These rays are very dangerous and can affect our health very badly. As we know, more money is needed to solve the health problem.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, reading books is more comfortable. Books have an emotional and sentimental value that cannot be replaced by digital media. Moreover, the act of holding a physical book, flipping through its pages and smelling the scent of paper is an integral part of the reading experience.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is true that technology has made easier to access information online, but I think physical books and newspapers will continue to hold a special place in people\u2019s bookcases and in their hearts.

Some people advocate that spending cash for access to libraries is significant , whereas others are of no strong feelings on the matter. This essay completely disagrees with the opinion and considers that consuming cash for libraries is worth instead of the internet. To begin, the essay believes that some opportunities are not provided by the internet for customers. In other words, well-written books might not be found on websites by individuals pursuing historical events since plenty of documents are able to disappear on the internet due to their unsecured situation. For instance, in 2019 a myriad of users could not access information on Wikipedia as it was hacked for a while. Hence, determining libraries instead of spending time with devices is likely to encourage population in order to research more. Secondly, not only does consuming money for libraries provide resources, it can also encourage individuals so as to be social. In other words, a multitude of relationships are established in libraries while people focus on their tasks, yet on the internet, users prefer to prevent their social distance from foreigns since no one knows  each other during meetings on the internet. For example, individuals who regularly go to libraries to study had to stay at home during the Corona-19 epidemic. Then, it was observed that the circumstances of public were likely to lessen their mood and psychological cases. Thus, spending money on libraries is not just a way to learn information from books because it is likely to contribute cognition of humans. To conclude, the essay strongly believes that sacrificing cash to access libraries is more beneficial than exploring something with technology since it makes folk accessible and peaceful. Some people think that the amount of money spent on the library is a waste as  new technologies are developing and replacing library functions.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is common nowadays for students at university or college to undertake part-\r\n\r\ntime work either for money or to gain some work experience. In my opinion, this has both advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe first obvious advantage is that work can bring in money. In many countries,\r\n\r\n students are independent from their families, or their parents are not wealthy enough to afford their education. Therefore, a part-time job can greatly contribute to the financial position of a student. It may be an essential factor in permitting study in the first place. For example, in Britain, the tuition fees have\r\n\r\nincreased a lot in recent years, which has kept some of the intelligent but poor\r\n\r\n students from concentrating on their study as they are often in debt and in severeshortage of financial support. As a result, if they want to continue their academic persuit, many students have no choice but to work in addition to their academic duties.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a part-time job can help prepare a person for the real world of work, a\r\n\r\n step out of the ivory tower. Many employers nowadays complain that new workers do not appreciate the needs of business, nor can they apply their theoretical study to practice. But some work experience gained during study can facilitate one to develop one\u2019s career. \r\n\r\nTo put it simply, the decision of whether or not to take up a part-time job while\r\n\r\n studying depends on individual students\u2019 circumstances \u2013 it may be beneficial or financially necessary, but it should never be at the cost of underachieving in academic work.'",

This, along with the development of modern industry, has led to higher levels of population in many city. As a result, the local environment and people\u2019s health are being negatively affected.\r\n\r\nCities with a large population are often especially polluted. This is because there is a greater concentration of cars and industry in a small area. Cities with both a large number of cars and a poor public transport system are often in a particularly bad situation as they suffer from high levels of noise and air pollution. Other cities, which have economies that rely on industry, have to deal with problems created by manufacturing. These can include air, water and soil polution, both locally and in a wider area aroung the city.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these two factors, pollution can have negative effects on both the local environment and people\u2019s well-being. Increased air pollution is often linked to a number of health concerns, particularly breathing problems. Both water and soil pollution can damage or kill a number of plant and animal species, and ultimately, this may affect the quality of the food available for human. Lastly, both transport and industry can increase noise and light pollution in cities. This can mean that people get poor sleep and their health may be affected by this.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some cities are becoming more polluted because they are becoming more populated which leads to growing amount of traffic and industrial production.

I wholeheartedly support this notion, as I believe that young minds are more adept at embracing fresh concepts and possess heightened learning capabilities. Furthermore, by the time they reach high school, they are already familiar with foreign languages, alleviating the pressure of additional subjects.\r\n\r\nResearch confirms that young children exhibit a remarkable capacity for absorbing new information. For instance, a study conducted on students in Iran demonstrated that elementary school pupils excel in acquiring English proficiency at a swifter pace and with greater fluency than their older counterparts. Thus, initiating language studies at an early age is more logical.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, high schoolers grapple with a demanding curriculum, and the inclusion of a new language course would only add to their academic load, potentially leading to frustration and diminished focus. Consequently, the intended goal of mastering a second language may remain unrealized, necessitating extra time and effort.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that introducing new subjects, such as a second language, to children at a young age is paramount, given their heightened aptitude for learning and mastering these subjects in comparison to older individuals.'",

Moreover, they do not know how to communicate with others, or how to solve group problems. Hence, only concentrating on their personal rewards or aims is dangerous as it is a driving force behind decreased communication skills and togetherness.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the nation should never neglect the value of collective interests as they are beneficial to mental health. It is undeniable that collective mindset brings a sense of belonging which is a key point of living a harmonized life with others. For example, we are living in a very socialised world with various people and thus, we need to learn how to communicate with each other. Having collective thinking helps to improve social skills and secure emotional stability. Also, a notable study conducted by Korea University revealed that possessing a sense of togetherness is firmly favorable to preventing mental illnesses such as dementia. Therefore, nations should be collective instead of being selfish. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although endeavouring people\u2019s personal goals and ambitions can be positive and negative at the same time, I believe that the bad impacts override the merits. Hence, we should avoid being individualistic.'",

In my opinion, putting too much pressure on children from their parents to succeed brings a devastating blow to their children. \r\n\r\nIrrefutably, children can be dependent on their parents. This is because the parents provide all things related to their children such as making study plans, researching information about homework, and preparing daily meals. This obviously leads them to become passive and this in turn results in negative issues, including anxiety, depression, and loneliness without their parents.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, children who are under too much pressure from their parents struggle with significant stress. In actual fact, studies undertaken by experts have revealed that plenty of children are forced to extremely long hours study for achiving a high-level performance by parents on a daily basis. This, therefore, brings about exhausted physical and mental status. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, appropriate pressures are significantly beneficial to children. In other words, since having a chance to think about success leads to making life goals, parental guidelines considerably support children\u2019s dreams and goals come true, so those are likely to strive to study for their objectives.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, appropriate pressures are significantly beneficial to children but children can be dependent on their parents and children struggle with significant stress.

Western countries such as America and Britain have relatively shorter office hours compared to Asian countries. Some claim economic development is superior in those nations with longer working hours. I wholeheartedly agree with this nation, as I will elaborate the following. \r\n\r\nLonger working hours often can bring higher productivity. Nowadays, economic competition has become more severe. The country which has faster and larger productivity stands up easily. Take Taiwan for example, people there tend to work more than 12 hours a day, along with fewer national holidays in comparison with Western countries, and it is undeniable that Taiwan\u2019s electric industry plays an indispensable role globally. This could be due to Taiwanese hard working characteristics. Additionally, economic stability and prosperity can also result from a long working time. This work pattern brings opportunities for jobs, contributing to the reduction in unemployment rate.  However, it still has certain drawbacks.\r\n\r\nWorking for a long time may cause potential physical and mental health problems. Worker\u2019s rest and sleep time can be deprived, leading to harmful health outcomes. For instance, Japan is well-known for long work hours. Though it is one of economic successful nations, its suicide rate which is related to work has climbed recently. Consequently, health issues should not be underestimated, especially in those nations that have this long working pattern. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, countries with longer office hours enable them to have higher productivity and be more competitive, making them have better economic development. However, sometimes it is at the expense of the employer's health, and people should be more aware of this issue to ensure the country's economic sustainability.'",

Some individuals believe that recycled trash is not as much as it should be. What they suggest is that governments are in charge of implementing some rules to be followed by citizens. I strongly believe that this can lead to a better environment for us and the next generations and setting some rules is the only way to prevent its side effects.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the amount of trash produced by houses is not enough recycled and this can be addressed by making some legal requirements. On the one hand, by setting some rules in order to force city duelers to be aware of recycling home waste it is beneficial for them. Firstly, some strict rules should be implemented to encourage society to buy the manufacturers which are made of recycled materials. For instance, people will be able to save more money by purchasing items which are manufactured with recycled materials because of the less expenditure that these products have.  \r\n\r\nAnother useful law is to implement some fines for people who do not care about separating their recyclable and non-recycleable trash from each other. In this way, it will take less time and money to detach these two kinds of rubbish.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, domestic trash recycling has been a controversy, some agreed that it is better to set some rules for it.

This trend has sparked contrasting opinions, with advocates and critics each representing valid arguments. This essay will analyze both perspectives and subsequently offer a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason for supporting the teenage as the best life and the prominent one is that this life is stress-free because, at this stage of life, peers do not have any tension on their minds for earning money or livelihood as their guardians are working for them to fulfill their necessities along with their desires. Furthermore, at this stage of life juveniles grow mentally as well as physically and these are the most precious days of their life-span. \r\n\r\nHowever, in adulthood, individuals get the freedom to make their own decisions for a better future. They do not get any pressure from their parents and are held liable for their actions. Moreover, if they are working and earning good, they do not need to get approval from anyone to buy items for them as they are financially independent. Hence, it is apparent why many people think the adult age is more happiest.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, young age is the happiest part of one's life cycle because it not only provides freedom to the person but also helps them to learn new chapters of life every day by meeting new people and this stage assists humans to innovate their minds as well by discovering new trajectory to make their business more lucrative. Ultimately, both age-stages have their merits, and the better approach aligns with the comfort level of the individual. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the matrimonials mentioned above teenage is a relaxed age but with the least freedom, but a young age provides financial security along with the right to make decisions. Hence, each approach offers unique benefits, but adulthood is better as in my opinion.'",

The usage of such substances has some reasons, such as becoming more beautiful or being famous and also consequences on the overall well-being and society,like the loss of natural beauty and health-related issues. This essay will discuss both the causes and effects of the trend.\r\n\r\nThe foremost cause of this issue is mostly considered a desire to be more appealing and attractive. To be more specific, some individuals accept whiter skin as a symbol of the ideal appearance, so it leads people to buy these creams. Furthermore, today most celebrities opt for using lighting products and participate in endorsement events after which it pulls the attention of the public. Consequently, the figure for the brightening cream usage is increasing day by day due to the promotion of the companies for getting more benefits.\r\n\r\nOne of the profound and possible consequences behind the problem is related to health concerns. Those who overuse such creams damage their natural appearance. In other words, it results in dermatologic diseases which sometimes make it impossible to return to the initial state of the skin. It has a detrimental impact not only on the skin  but also on overall well-being. To elaborate, if  skin cancer occurs, other diseases will be inevitable.

The first positive effect of this idea that is people can communicate with people with ease around the world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it will bring positive effects on globalization, certainly, improving educational development and employment opportunities in developing countries. Indeed, most people in poorer nations who have good skills are hesitated applying for jobs abroad due to a lack of English ability and many young adults  are interested in continuing their studies outside the country because they perceive that English is difficult. For instance, many college students in Indonesia have a dream of getting master's in a richer country; however, they change their minds by deciding to apply master's degree in Indonesia in order to IELTS requirement. Therefore,  making English as global English will give many benefits for people , especially in education and job prospects.\r\n\r\nConversely, although it offers many positive benefits, it has many adverse effects.

Why is this happening?\r\n\r\nDo you think this will have a positive or negative impact on society?' \n 'Text': 'In digital era, the advancement of technology has led to the development of robots and artificial intelligence systems that are increasingly capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans. This trend is driven by various factors, including the desire for increased efficiency, cost reduction, and the potential to minimize human error. However, while the rise of robots in the workplace promises to revolutionize industries, it also raises significant questions about its impact on society.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary reasons behind the development of robots and AI in the workplace is the quest for efficiency. Machines can often perform repetitive tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, leading to increased productivity and reduced operational costs for businesses. For example, in manufacturing plants, robots can work around the clock without the need for breaks or rest, leading to higher output levels and decreased production time.\r\n\r\n Another reasons are that robots and AI have the potential to minimize human error, particularly in high-risk industries such as healthcare and transportation. By automating certain processes, these technologies can help prevent accidents and improve safety standards. In healthcare, for instance, AI-powered diagnostic systems can analyze medical images with greater accuracy than human professionals, leading to more precise diagnoses and better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the development of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges for society. While automation can increase efficiency and productivity, it also raises concerns about job displacement and inequality. To mitigate these challenges, it is essential to invest in education and training programs to prepare workers for the changing labor market and ensure that the benefits of automation are shared equitably across society.'",

In light of this, I contend that this event takes place due to the increment in efficiency and sales. From my perspective. I think this innovation plays a crucial role in our daily life and have a positive effect on my study and  work in the future.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognised that robots and artificial intelligence help businesses to improve productivity and work performance. which is really vital for each company to gain more profit. Besides, this technology also limits  time and strength, which helps employees save  time to do  important other things. In other words, AI can automatically conduct  industrial procedures without any human support. For instance, in China's logistics, they prefer to use machines in the period of production instead of labours, which helps them not only s\r\n\r\nave  time but also gain more efficiency. Therefore, the invention of this technology brings various benefits to our life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to social impact, it is evident that the promotion of global innovation brings to us various positive changes. Firstly, artificial intelligence can increase the efficiency of work which helps employees handle  repetitive tasks across an organization so that the labourers can focus on creative solutions and complex problem-solving. Moreover, robots are very supportive in helping scientists solve some difficult mathematics so that they can get rid of physical limitations better than humans. As a result, robot existence in the workplace not only causes  time consumption but also reinforces scientific progress, which helps produce some global breakthroughs. For example, look at the BioC company which is known by the medical business in France. The scientists here only concentrate on experimenting with the data whereas the other tasks such as identifying a number of cells are completed by robotic factors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  robots and artificial intelligence have developed in the company.

Most people nowadays have virtual assistants such as Siri from Apple or Google Assistant from Google to arrange schedules, send emails or take notes on their behalf. These transformations can open up new opportunities for society and help the individual better manage their lives. In my individual's views, despite many great advances, artificial intelligence technologies are still very far from possessing an algorithm that is capable of replicating human emotions. The best artificial intelligence devices can do so far is to mimic basic facial expressions and to voice these concerns.  However, this is no different from displaying an error message when there is an obstruction in their pre-programmed workflow.

The main reason given to support this claim is that  men are physically stronger than women. Therefore, they have been better at working in police as well as in building whereas women are better at teaching. In other words, you will be avoiding  exhausting working hours if you work  according to your body characteristics and abilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, there remains some disagreement in this topic. Some people think that work should be equally distributed between men and women. For example, feminism argues that women have the ability to do all the jobs in the world which I don't agree with. From my experience as a physics teacher at a mixed-courses college, I can greatly contend that women are better at this job for different reasons. Firstly, male co-workers are more serious and this job needs a lot of flexibility with students. People tend to get low marks with their teacher being a male and vice versa. Secondly, there are huge responsibilities on men's shoulders that they can not focus and give 100% of their energy to their class. Women are the ones who are better at teaching. \r\n\r\nIn a way of conclusion, although men and women have the right to choose their dream work, there are specific jobs better to be done by men and others should not go except for women.

However, in my opinion, the better way to handle this kind of problem is to seriously impose the death penalty law.  This essay will discuss both perspectives.\r\n\r\nNowadays, crimes are rampant in our society. Killers are not afraid to kill other people. Because the authority does not have strict legislation for criminals if they commit a crime a direct punishment will be implemented. As a result, more and more citizens are becoming cruel. Therefore, imposing a serious law is what the government and authority need to do so that all the people will respect it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the state takes measures other than the death penalty this might create a bad image and this will further aggravate the problem of crimes. People will not abide by the law because there is no serious punishment for it. For instance, a study from the Philippines noticed that if there are stricter laws, crime rates are also lower. Because people are afraid to be directly incarcerated and be punished to death.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the death penalty is the only solution to decrease the crimes in society. This sends a message that every committed atrocity has a consequence and that includes death. In this event only we can feel safe in the place where we live.'",

Because of this event people especially grown-ups are frustrated gradually.For example, in labour positions staff have to work all weekdays and also they have forced extra hours and if they do not participate in this schedule their job will be in danger so they ignore  their basic needs and families just to be able to keep food on table of the household.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this program has a few benefits that can be beneficial just in the short-term ,such as, for beginner workers and inexperience population they can spend more time  working and grab as much information as possible in a short period of time. However, if this timetable lasts longer it will illustrate its side effects that can be harmful to both the mental and physical aspects of the human body and personal life.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, spending more future in the occupation position in the erosion process  can cause a major number of decreases,however, it is good but just for those who are immature and want to do this activity in short length.'",

What are the reasons of this\r\n\r\ntrend?

So the population that used to live life as simply as possible and in the most effortless way  reduce the amount of time that spending on bicycles because of needs for physical activities.\r\n\r\n To tackle this problem,  governments should start programs that encourage people to practice their bikes instead of other ways ,flexible times for starting their work day and healthy meals for those who service their personal health method. For illustration, they can introduce laws that support bike travellers and give them this opportunity to travel between their home and office in a safe way so  suggesting adaptable starting work hours could help them to finish their journey in the safest way.\r\n\r\n All in all, in my view cycling, is a really advantageous form of transport, however, it is going to be unpopular gradually and the authorities can solve it by introducing some laws and some opportunities for users to power up their motion to handle it.'",

In order to\r\n\r\nbecome integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their\r\n\r\nold ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behavior.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'There is no doubt that these days immigration become increasingly favourable. The question is, is it really important to migrate and what are the costs? In this essay, I am going to discuss the new trend of people being transformed totally into another country as well as the advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, I will draw my own conclusion regarding  this subject.\r\n\r\nIn order of advantages, the latest research showed that the people of developing countries that are integrated in modern nations have experienced easier lifestyle situations. The main reason given to support this claim is that once the people are involved in the biggest countries, the services presented will be greatly facilitated. In other words, people will avoid time and effort which is more likely to be consumed in their own countries. Therefore, they prefer to leave their places wishing for an easier life.\r\n\r\nHowever, this way of travelling witnessed numerous drawbacks. Firstly, transformed people will be always considered as non-loyal individuals as they leave their original homeland. In other words, despite the comfort of life, they will always experience  homesickness due to the distance from their loved ones and their neighbourhood. Secondly, it is difficult to integrate into a new culture and change your original behaviour and language. For example, people immigrating into China will take a long time to understand the lifestyle and sometimes it might be impossible and risky. \r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, although there are several beneficial aspects regarding  immigration, it is not easy to leave your homeland and there are several problems you will be facing if you decide to take such a huge step. Therefore, governments must increase the awareness of both sides of their people and ease the services to save their population.'",

I think this may pose a threat to their health and waste their time, although people can have opportunities to find useful methods. \r\n\r\nThese tests will lead to potential dangers to their bodies. Many people are allergic to something such as nuts, so when they try new medicines, they may be unaware that these goods may cause damage to their health. For instance, if a patient who is allergic to apples takes a medication containing nutritions which comes from apples, he/she will feel uncomfortable and even need an ambulance. In daily lives, their common doctor will prevent them from having these things because they are familiar with their patients. \r\n\r\nThis thing may also be responsible for a waste of time for people. Trying new treatments and obtaining the results can cost a lot of time but finally, they may find these treatments are useless. So they fail to cure themselves and lose their valuable time. There are lots of civilians trying times and times, however, they earn nothing and just waste their time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trying new things gives people chances to find the right methods. Human beings have magic bodies and nowadays nobody knows everything about our bodies. As a result, no one can make sure that they give the appropriate medicines and treatments to their consumers. So if the one keeps trying different ways, he/she may find what he/she wants at last--if the right method has been invented! \r\n\r\nTo sum up, trying different medicines and curations alloww people to be likely to find the ways that are suitable to themselves, but this will present a challenge to their bodies and just be a waste of time.'",

That is to say, The more competitive they are and the more they want to do well, the better their skills will improve. For example, in high school in South Korea, students are graded on the scale of their studies, owing to this, children always compare their scale to peers and have a desire to grow than before. For this reason, they try to study harder.\r\n\r\n However, if everyone in society were eager to beat someone then collaboration, I believe it would have a harmful effect on both individuals and the nation. If they learn only competition throughout the entire study period, it means they don't learn how to interact, care, and cooperate with others, and it will have a negative impact on their social life as  adults. In addition to, they feel blue or have low self-esteem easily because of comparing to peers. For instance, young people feel like they are not good enough because they are always focusing on what others are doing better.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, it is certain people benefit from competing with others.

Thus, it would be a good idea for the school to teach both competition and cooperation so that everyone could learn more balanced thoughts in life.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people.\r\n\r\nWhy might this be the case?\r\n\r\nDo you think this is a positive or negative situation?' \n 'Text': 'It is no doubt that possession of a house is often considered to be an essential aspect of life. Therefore some people firmly believe that having their own living places would be more advantageous than renting one. The causes of this tendency will be discussed and the benefits will be argued. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main reason why owning a home is vital for individuals is because it provides a sense of security and stability. Rental housing can frequently be unpredictable as landlords may raise rental prices and decide to sell property. For instance, a family rents an apartment for several years, in which a comfortable life has been established: children attend schools nearby and parents have installed friendly relations with local residents. However, the landlord unexpectedly bursts with the informing them to vacate the flat since he has decided to live there himself. Therefore, it is much better to have their own residential building due to the fact that homeowners control their houses and are not dependent on the whims of landlords. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it is a positive trend not only because gives a sense of permanence and belonging but it also can be a good investment. Over time estate becomes more expensive, which means that homeowners can potentially make a profit if they sell their homes later. As an illustration, during the housing boom in the early 2000s, the reality of many people who owned an apartment in attractive locations increased dramatically. Hence, having an own house has many advantages. \r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the economic stability and safety convince individuals to buy a house instead of renting it. Home ownership gives homeowners a sense of security and stability and can also be a good investment. It plays an integral role in citizens\u2019 lives. Moreover, owning a flat is a goal that many people around the world strive for, and it's worth it.'",

While these social skills could improve employee management and bring effective networking, these could social skills could not determine exact qualification and abilities. \r\n\r\nWhat extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Recently, more and more people have been paying attention to social skills.There are people who say that social skills are the most important additional qualification for success. I firmly believe that these skills are really necessary to stay in a good position in the workplace. In this essay, I will present my point of view. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason I support this phenomenon is that many companies find employees who have good communication skills. such people have a lot of self-confidence to communicate with recipients. For example, in sales and marketing jobs, employees must rely on their own strength to convince customers by advertising their products.After that, their profits will increase when the number of customers increases.Moreover, in multinational jobs, employees have to communicate with foreigners.In such cases, personal contact is more important. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnother reason I agree with this statement is that satisfactory behavior plays an important role in the workplace. In an expanded industry, people work in a team and they have a leader.If the manager and the employees treat each other badly, the project cannot be completed successfully. For example, in an IT-related job, one person cannot complete the entire project in the shortest possible time. Moreover, they solve it with the help of 12 or 14 employees. In this case, acceptable behavior can create good relationships and give energy.In addition, you can share the problem with others if the other person behaves very well. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n To sum up, nowadays people can't do anything well due to a lack of social skills. if people have skills such as communication skills and good behavior, as well as academic skills.they will succeed in their professional life'",

While there are the number of individuals who hold the idea that stars should not be constantly followed by the media and to give them privacy, others contend that this is the fame they have earned so there is no harm in doing so. I will discuss both the views in following paragraphs providing my opinion at the end.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand number of people think that the media should respect the privacy of celebrities and  not follow them to click on their photos wherever they go. Everyone holds a right to have privacy during their personal life movements and the same applies to superstars as well. For instance, when celebrities do not want to reveal  their life events they should be given privacy. Being constantly watched by sometime is sometimes very traumatic, which leads to  unwanted stress in life.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that their stardom is because of the media\u2019s attention by keeping them always in lime lite. Therefore many think that famous celebrities reach  that level with the support of the media and the love of fans, hence it is righteous to know about their every movement. If favourite star gets married privately, this might leave a negative sentimental effect on fans. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although fans are interested to know about their star\u2019s routine life, in my opinion they deserve to live dignified and respected private lives with their family and loved ones.

It can be rest, culture, or business because people can do all sometimes with their schedule. Therefore they do not want to change their schedule. On the other hand, others prefer to be spontaneous because they want to only get rest and enjoy. I strongly believe that we can prefer both according to our situation and I going to explain some specific reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, discipline is so important while doing the program because if you change your activity you can be late or lose your real program or job. For example,  some business person travel too much for their job. They join some activities which are interesting if they have time  that travel. Of course, they do not want to change their vacation activities because they go  there for specific reasons if they change their program maybe they can lose their real job. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people do not like going on holiday according to any program and love too much spontaneity. The reasons for that are first, it can be so exciting because you do not know what you can do. Second, it can be so fun for people to enjoy without the program. Third, you can meet different people whom you do not know. For instance, one of my friends went from  Gaziantep to Antalya. he went walking and hitchhicking for cars. He told me it was a really amazing trip because I met a lot of different people on the way. Of course, it had a bad side. For example, you can see dangerous people.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, to stay in the plan or without any plan we can couse both according to our goal. .

What is your opinion?' \n 'Text': 'There is a prevailing notion that temporary jobs offer greater flexibility and freedom compared to full-time employment, allowing individuals to allocate their time as they please. While it is true that temporary employment can yield a substantial income, I contend that the stability and security provided by full-time positions outweigh the benefits of temporary work.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, individuals engaged in temporary jobs enjoy the flexibility to balance work and personal life. However, the unpredictable nature of their earnings often renders saving money challenging, leaving them vulnerable in times of financial need. For instance, in emergencies such as unexpected medical expenses, having a stable income becomes indispensable. According to recent statistics, over 60% of individuals in temporary positions struggle to save money due to fluctuating incomes. In my country, securing loans for significant investments like real estate typically necessitates proof of stable employment and income.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, temporary employment can be advantageous for those adept at financial management and time allocation. Despite the fluctuating income, individuals must exercise prudence in budgeting and expenditure. Moreover, the surplus time available can be utilized for self-improvement endeavors, such as acquiring new skills or languages. While additional job opportunities may augment earnings, effective time management becomes paramount. Transitioning between jobs smoothly can also be challenging; however, with proper planning and foresight, individuals can mitigate these challenges.\r\n\r\nIn light of the aforementioned considerations, the conclusion becomes apparent. While temporary employment facilitates a favorable work-life balance and offers opportunities for personal development, it also entails inherent risks and uncertainties. Therefore, I advocate for full-time employment as it provides a dependable income foundation and greater financial security.'",

This essay will first suggest that the biggest problem caused by this phenomenon is the current state of technology and then present advice to limit the overuse of electronic devices. the most feasible solution.\r\n\r\n     The foremost problem caused by the development of the technological age is electronic devices with addictive games. millions of people around the world spend too much time playing games when they are at home and most of those games take a lot of time to complete. The consequence is that it affects each person's lifestyle, making them feel lazier and want to stay home and play games instead of going out with some friends.

To explain, Parents should advise or manage their children to consider using electronic devices for entertainment, limit gaming to no more than three hours a day and convince them with some outdoor activity. For instance, Parents should regularly spend time with their children or take them on picnics or participate in other outdoor activities with them, especially team building games that help increase family relationships and stay away from children's electronic devices.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, spending too much time at home can have many negative effects on children or adolescents.

Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that we should increase the prices of sugar products so that less sugar will be eaten. I think that this may cause damage to the sugar industry and cause people to live unhappy lives, although people can be healthier.\r\n\r\nThis idea can pose a threat to the sweet-food manufacturers because there will be fewer people buying their goods. As we all know, the higher the price of an item is ,the less customers buy it. So if we make sugary products more expensive, a lot of people will abandon them and buy other products to enjoy themselves and as a result, the sweet food industry will fail to sell their products and be endangered. For example, citizens may prefer to buy more fast food like chips to have fun instead of sugar drinks or foods. The damage to the sugar industry may also lead to the unemployment of workers. \r\n\r\nThe higher price may also be responsible for an unhappy life. It is evident that sweet foods and beverages are the favourite goods of many civilians and eating sugar is a good way to enable people to feel happiness. So when we raise the prices of sugary products, fewer people can afford them and they lose a method to satisfy themselves. This will result in a worse life, especially for the poor-- they have few methods to have fun and one of the main ways is prohibited.\r\n\r\nHowever, people may have better bodies if they take in less sweet things.

However, some think that these activities are not beneficial for a child\u2019s mental health' \n 'Text': 'In modern society, it is much easier for children to get computer games and spend more time on TV than before. Besides, parents are busy finishing and handling their work. As a result, they do not have enough time to accompany their children. And parents will use TV and games to accompany their children. Thus, children waste a lot of time on this electronic entertainment. Is it a negative effect on children's mental abilities? To me, I agree with this point. I think watching TV and playing computer games are negative on children's mental abilities.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, watching TV and playing computer games cause children to reduce thinking. TV programs and computer games provide numerous images and sounds. Children do not have the opportunity to imagine and create their thinking. They lose the opportunity to think and grow up. It will affect children's mental abilities. By contrast, activities like reading or drawing develop many areas of the brain and help children to think and imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, children will decrease interaction with other people because of spending much time watching TV and playing computer games. When children spend a lot of time watching TV and playing computer games all day, they will not have time and the opportunity to play outdoors with other people. Physical activity also helps with brain development. Therefore, children should be discouraged from watching TV and playing computer games.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, our bodies and minds need to move and think. If we stop them moving, our bodies and minds will get worse. Therefore, we should help children's mental abilities through reading and drawing instead of spending too much time watching TV and playing computer games.'",

Moreover, 80 percent of the elderly spend their money on reading.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I said in the beginning, teenagers don\u2019t need to buy a newspaper because some of them don\u2019t even follow the daily news. According to research, only 20 percent of teenagers follow the daily news day by day. Therefore, the purchasing power of newspapers and books has decreased for the last ten decades.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I strongly agree that if we want to learn news, we can easily and quickly get it from social media.'",

Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'A group of individuals present the idea that there should be a certain punishment for any type of crime, while others believe that the circumstances of the criminals and the motive for committing the crime should be considered in deciding on the punishment. I completely agree with the former opinion and my reasons for the same will be presented in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people justifiably argue that unintentional crimes can pose a threat to the safety of society. \r\n\r\nOnce a criminal escapes punishment he may be encouraged to commit more crimes. As a result, the citizens of the society are not able to live their lives peacefully. The situation is complicated by the fact that people find it difficult to recognize criminals from normal persons in the city. As a result, the sense of trust can be seriously damaged and this causes major problems for city residents. In other words, people fail to attend social activities, go to their workplaces or even go on holidays. Therefore, a large section of the community will suffer the consquences of not punishing the criminals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of people claim that the influencing environmental factors and incentives of criminals to commit crimes should always be taken into consideration before deciding on their punishment. They emphasize that financial issues, family problems etc. are the reasons leading to crime. However, this argument does not convince me because criminals are responsible for their violent acts. They should be discouraged from committing any kind of crime so that the society remains safe.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my view, punishment can act as a deterrent and prevent the spread of violence in the community. Moreover, fair punishments make the society safer.'",

To what extend do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'In today\u2019s fast-paced world, spending taxes on public libraries and transportation has become a vital issue. Personally, I partially agree with this appointment because there are some reasons why I think like that. I completely believe that investing money in public libraries by the government can be more beneficial, while it is crucial for also public transportation.\r\n\r\n  One of the most significant and major reasons why I think so is that  recent scientific research shows that approximately 78% of people claim that the government should spend their money which comes from taxes for improving library facilities because some people cannot afford to study at homes as they do not have any kind of resources to learn new information in their field. So, they need to go to public libraries, and find appropriate books or other types of sources to do some research. As for online research, nearly half of the young generations who come from poor families cannot pay a fee for the network. It is optimal that if the government spend taxes on libraries, this time more people may utilize this staff\u2019s amenities, including using technological appliances in order to search a relevant website.\r\n\r\n    However, using money on means of transportation can be an ideal way to supply people with a comfortable environment. A growing number of people believe that it is more prevalent to get more opportunities on public transport as their numbers are limited. For example, some people, including me argue that it is the better option for preventing crowded places which are caused by having more people than necessary. In addition, some people do not have any money to utilize public transport like buses, or underground. It can be the better way, if poor people do not have to pay any money for consuming transport.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I believe that both aspects are important to make our life a brilliant and beautiful place to live. Therefore, the government should spend tax money on both public libraries and transport.'",

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Parents are in a crucial position of affecting their children directly and it is acknowledged parenting is important in children\u2019s development. So, I totally disagree with this statement. Of course, parents can help with their kid\u2019s homework, but children should have to learn self-management and problem-solving abilities. \r\n\r\nThese days, it is on the table that children are becoming too much dependent on their parents. They learn how to manage themselves from their parent\u2019s behavior and how their parents treat them. Spending time with their children is important. Therefore, parents should spend time with their kids in a productive and efficient way. For example, going for a walk in the park, having dinner together, or doing something active and enjoyable, not helping homework.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, they need to improve problem-solving skills when they are young. They can realize how can they solve various problems more wisely and efficiently later on. Thus, they would be able to deal with any problem or concern they may face such as those related to relationship or work. For instance, they can learn many things when they do homework by themselves, such as societal, mathematical, scientific, even cultural concepts. Children can learn how to approach each problem when they are doing assignments alone. Parents could encourage their kids to discuss with other prople when they face difficult problems or don\u2019t have any clue about them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that parents should help their kids with their homework.

From my point of view, this viewpoint may be a negative trend, which provides some drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThe major reason why folks prefer to be self-employed rather than to work for a certain company is that the income that they obtain from doing a routine job is not enough. To illustrate, in Thailand, the minimum rate of salaries for those who have a bachelor's degree is 15,000 baths per month. As a result, a lot of people who have recently graduated from universities chose to be self-employed. Furthermore, many people would not like to encounter the awful working atmosphere. In other words, some office workers can not be tolerant of unfavourable behavior of their bosses and co-workers. As a consequence, they decided to resign and begin to run their own businesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the obvious disadvantages of being self-employed is that business owners must address numerous hardships by themselves. In simple terms, if they face any problems, they have to find solutions to tackle those issues by themselves. On top of that, business owners still have some expenditures even if their businesses experience a financial loss. That is to say, although their businesses do not have profits, they still have to pay for their employees, raw materials, and even the rent in some cases.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there are numerous reasons why people presently choose to run thier own businesses rather than doing a routine job, and this trend may offer some disadvantages.'",

I agree with this opinion. \r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that they share more  commonalities with peers than with parents.  They possess similar traits and characteristics like creativity or being driven \uff0cand most of them are facing similar difficulties: the pressure of getting into a decent university ,  finding a promising job or the confusion about their passions or their identity. Thus, the young generation would most likely think that friends of a similar age can better appreciate their position/stand in their shoes, providing them more practical suggestions than parents. In this case, they tend to be more open to friends and willing to follow their advice. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is related to social and emotional perspectives.  For one thing, most young people are uncertain about many aspects ( social \u7684A) in life and would worry about making mistakes. Such fear would cause them to assume that what the majority of their friends do is correct and end up imitating their thoughts and behaviour to seek a sense of certainty, but they would resist copying parents due to the age gap and different exposures to life. For another, as younger people are also afraid of feeling lonely and isolated/ do not want to feel being left behind, conforming to friends\u2019 behaviour helps them get along with friends and develop a strong bond and sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, young people are more likely to be affected by friends than by adults due to their shared difficulties and the desire of belonging to a group and feeling assured.'",

Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that it would be  better for children to  live in the countryside rather than in a big city.In my opinion, I completely disagree with this point of view and I believe that the advantages grow up in the city  far outweigh the advantages of the countryside,which can be supported by the reasons as follows.\r\n\r\nFirstly and foremost,  there are multiple inconveniences for  children living in the suburbs.Obviously, with the development of the economy,  subsequently, there exists an imbalance between the city centre and the suburbs, not to mention the countryside, including not only the level of education, healthcare,and entertainment infrastructures  but also the opportunities to get into touch with different experiences. For example, in the big city, the latest and most sophisticated technologies would help children avoid  various diseases. At the same time, the advanced educational systems and resources would provide broadened knowledge and insights, which can help youngsters have a leading stage compared to the country's peers. What's more, the existence of vibrant entertainment can provide an impressive and delightful childhood duration. It is important to the mental health of adolescents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, keeping children away from the countryside would ensure safety. It is undeniable that lacking  monitors may have a potential impact on  crime. Furthermore,the limited safeguard methods are another dangerous factor that would jeopardise the life of any individual.For instance,once there are some arsons who commit a crime and fire a house, there are few emergency methods or tools to stamp it off. Thus, the children have no chance of living in a completely safe circumstance.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that it would be better to let children spend their childhood in a big city,not only for the more advanced technologies, but more importantly ,safety.In this case,governments and families should devote sufficient efforts to make it come true.'",

While some parents think that teaching mathematics is unimportant, other parents believe that this subject is a fundamental part of education. This essay wil discuss both sides of this topic.' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, the topic of mathematics in schools has become increasingly prominent. Moreover, some parents argue that maths is not important, whereas some believe it is a fundamental part of education. Thus, this essay will discuss the cognitive impact of mathematics, while also considering the educational obligation that schools have to accommodate all types of learners. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers for various aspects of a child's cognitive development. For example, a study done at Harvard University found that mathematical concepts are found in everyday objects, and that the average person unknowingly uses mathematics about 80% a day when identifying objects or solving complex problems. Furthermore, mathematics is vital to advance technology and perform breakthrough inventions that can benefit the future. Thus, it is essential to acknowledge that maths plays a momentous role on someone's intellectual abilities and can be considered as a fundamental part of education. \r\n\r\nSecondly, all educational institutions have a moral standard to accommodate different students. To illustrate this, High School Sunrise do not include maths as part of their curriculum, because 65% of their students have a below average IQ. Given this, it is imperative that schools still enhance learning, even towards children who have intellectual disabilities. In addition to this, it is notable that mathematics is unimportant in cases like these, however, if a student has the cognitive skills to do maths, then it should be encouraged. Hence, maths is important in some cases, but there are exceptions where it is not important. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is my contention that schools should encourage mathematics where possible, but  keep in mind that not all students have the cognitive skills to master the subject. If students are encouraged to develop according to their abilities, then a more balanced lifestyle might occur in the foreseeable future.'",

This essay discusses why the benefits of this phenomenon, such as convenience and safety, surpass the drawbacks of individuals sometimes having technical difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe first merit of using bank applications instead of physical cash is that it is more convenient for people. This is because carrying just one piece of equipment instead of a bunch of cedules and coins is more practical for most people's lifestyles. For example, many individuals have stopped carrying physical money because they may need more than what they have on hand. Therefore, when people opt for paying apps they have more flexibility to spend the amount they need or want.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is safer to use phone apps instead of physical money. This is due to the security installed into these applications, in case they end up in the wrong hands, while cedules can be easily lost or stolen. For instance, new studies say that travellers who carry physical cash are eight times more susceptible to getting robbed. In comparison, people who only get their cellphones robbed often lose less money, due to apps' cryptography security.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also a downside to using mobile applications as the major payment method. This is the difficulty that individuals sometimes experience when no internet is available. Officers usually recommend travellers carry a bit of cash in case their mobile data runs out or their phones' batteries shut down. If this happens, people may find themselves in a different country without any monetary resources, which can cause serious issues and time wasted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main merits of using bank apps as a payment method such as the practicality and the security, outweigh the negative aspect of people sometimes having technical problems due to internet connection or running out of battery. Furthermore, these issues can be solved by looking for free wifi establishments and also, carrying portable charges in case needed.'",

Their primary resources are easily accessible within our surroundings, eliminating the necessity for further exploration of those secluded, distant territories. Harnessing alternative materials is also advantageous, on account of their eco-friendly natures. Ample evidence has demonstrated that biodiesel emits less carbon dioxide in the air, resulting in healthier air for living creatures to breathe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, awareness is still an urgent necessity in our society that requires serious attention.

This essay will argue that the teenage years are the best time in each person's life.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, these days a lot of people think that living as a teenager is the best thing that can happen to someone. The vast majority of teenagers do not have any concerns about daily problems and the only issue in their life is how to plan for their plays where they can have an unforgivable time. In my point of view teenagers not only do not have concerns about big problems such as monetary problems or how to feed their family but also their families provide them with everything in terms of financially and mentally. For instance, a survey which was conducted in my area in 2015 showed that only 3% per cent of the young generation knew the meaning of anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people have this concept that living as a mature person in society could be the dream time of every person. Since some individuals are passionate about taking some responsibilities in their daily lives and can be known as a grown man or woman, this feeling will give them to be important. So, by having this feeling about life and work, people think being an adult is the best period of their life. However, when you have different tasks in your life, you are put under heavy pressure as well as financial problems. As a result, these huge concerns would create a situation where individuals could be treated by mental illness. For example, more than 45% of employees who are working in my company have anxiety because of heavy duties and a lot of pressure.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in some people's minds, there is a concept that when you are living as a teenager you will have a happy life, while others think in the opposite way where they think adult life would be a much happier time. But, children do not have any concerns in their life, so, they will be much happier and more passionate about life.'",

I totally agree that free access to these websites lays the foundation for great interest among people.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, technological advancements in the future can enable people to access easily to different sources of information in the Internet, and encourage them not to purchase printed products. News companies and writers may give the preference to share the online version of their newspapers and books through the Internet without demanding money in order to reach an increasing number of readers and become more popular. This is because, nowadays many individuals have greater opportunities to use online websites rather in than the past, and a range of chances become more accessible every day. Therefore, I agree that they can draw the attention of users by making their resources completely free.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the owners of these websites can earn a large amount of money from the social media companies with the help of views and subscribers which do not demand certain payment. These earnings which websites gain are getting larger because of the growing number of users, and thus owners will not need to sell their newspapers and books. So, both admins and users can benefit from the upsides of the online sources in terms of income.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some people consider that traditional ways of reading newspapers and books will maintain their popularity, I believe that people are likely to prefer online methods in order to avoid paying money.'",

Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of this' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, the income from tourism has become increasingly prominent. While some experts believe that tourism can benefit the economy of a country, others say that it alleviates small communities. Personally, I strongly advocate for the former view. Thus, this essay aims to explore the benefits and drawbacks that tourism has on countries. \r\n\r\nOne notable benefit of tourism is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of an economy. This trend is twofold; touristic attractions provide financial aid for the transportation and hospitality sectors of a country, which overall impacts the GDP of an economy. For instance, the city of Cape Town is the richest city in South Africa due to Table Mountain, which is a momentous destination that attracts individuals from around the world. Given this, restaurants, hotels, local craft shops and transportation systems have gained significantly from this phenomenon. Therefore, it is my opinion that tourism is an advantage for all countries. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are merits to this trend, it fails to support peaceful towns. To illustrate this, Margate Beach has become extremely popular, which resulted in local residents to relocate. Furthermore, towns that has become succumbed to tourism, often neglect the peacefulness that once resided in the town. With more tourists in the area, traffic congestions worsen and the area becomes overpopulated. Hence, while there are immensive benefits, tourism can also disturb the lives of locals.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it can cause a disturbance for some native communities, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If tourism continues to grow, then more economies might benefit.'",

Some people think that music can be beneficial in gathering people together from different backgrounds. I totally agree with this point of view for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, music can help people to communicate easily with others who have different cultures. For example, music can be used by a person in small talk to introduce himself or herself. If someone listens to music that is popular around the globe, he or she can comment about it on social media and also can see others' comments. As a result, people from different areas can be friends by sharing their ideas about the same songs.\r\n\r\nThe second reason why I think so is that concerts can help bring people from various cultures into one area and help them to meet new friends. For instance, the young generation has a big interest in concerts from popular singers and they mainly go abroad for these concerts. If someone travels to another country to participate in concerts, he or she can meet local residents and  share his or her own culture and also learn the local traditions of the country. However, this can lead to cultural exchange and help people to hone their minds.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into account, in my opinion, music can help people to learn about different cultures as they can share their ideas by using social media tools and also taking part in concerts can be a good way for people to meet new friends and learn more things about their cultures and traditions.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Spoken communication is more powerful than written communication. To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: orally and in written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people.'",

To help find answers, they should ask the elderly in the neighbourhoods. \r\n\r\nSome people done some research on stories of their homes simply for the sake of curiosity.

This makes the residents of those buildings can\u2019t help to find out more about them, such as when they were built, who lived there, and why they look the way they do.\r\n\r\nThere are also people who delve into the past to ensure their safety. There are still many people who believe in superstitions like ghosts. Particularly in the old houses that withstand years of different generations of ownership. There is a possibility that suicide or murder happened all those years ago, and the current occupant is afraid the lingering souls will come for them and disturb their peaceful lives.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the best solutions for people to explore, is to reach out to the senior residents in their neighbourhood.  Some of them have lived in the same place all their lives. They have seen all the changes happening around them. They have witnessed others coming and going. Talking with them should be able to uncover some intriguing stories from the past regarding one\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, curiosity and motivation to find if there is a supernatural phenomenon in their house are two possible reasons why people want to investigate their house\u2019s history.

What is your opinion?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, selfishness has become increasingly prominent. Some argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the lack of caring for others, which alleviates kindness. It is my contention that kind-heartedness can improve mental health and promote adequate standards for future generations, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of mental well-being. For example, psychologist Edwin Charles mentions that the brain releases large amounts of dopamine when showing kindness, which in return stimulates one's brain to be happier. Moreover, almost 80% of suicides are caused by a lack of kindness. Thus, without even knowing it, being friendly to a stranger can decrease depression and trauma for them. Therefore, it is evident that pure actions might both improve someone's own mentality and others. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is essential to underscore the impact that modern actions could have on humans in the foreseeable future. To illustrate this, anthropologist Kathy Steward explains that 50% of an individual's  actions are influenced by their parents. Given this, the concatenation of moral values and standards that are being taught to today's children could be learned by their offspring, which continues the cycle of rudeness; unless it is stopped and replaced with kindness. Hence, humbleness can create a beter life for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is notable that kindness can increase mental health and promote the quality of life. It is my opinion that if kindness is disseminated throughout the globe, then the lives of all humans can benefit.'",

They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are required to make people recycle more of their waste?' \n 'Text': 'In today's society, environmental sustainability has witnessed transformative innovation. With the rise of environmental awareness, the question of  whether waste recycling in households is sufficient has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts argue that governments should enact laws to regulate and encourage recycling. From my perspective, while laws may help improve recycling rates, they are not the sole solution to increasing recycling.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that legal mandates can effectively raise awareness and encourage compliance with recycling practices. When recycling is legally required, individuals are more likely to take it seriously and incorporate it into their daily routines. Moreover, enforcement mechanisms such as fines or penalties can incentivize compliance and deter individuals from neglecting their recycling responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on legislation to promote recycling overlooks the importance of education and public engagement. Laws can set the framework for recycling initiatives, but they may not address underlying issues such as lack of awareness or motivation. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines legal mandates with educational campaigns and community involvement is essential for long-term success in promoting recycling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, enforcing recycling laws may pose logistical challenges and strain resources, especially in regions with limited infrastructure or economic constraints. In such cases, alternative strategies such as incentivizing recycling through rewards or subsidies may be more effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while laws can be a valuable tool in promoting recycling, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes education, public engagement, and incentives. By adopting a multifaceted approach, governments can create a culture of sustainability and encourage responsible waste management practices among citizens.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'While some claim that leadership skill is an inborn quality of an individual, others believe that anyone also become a leader in the future thanks to practice. From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why leadership skill is a god-given talent is because a leader is the most important person in an organization or company due to their inborn qualities. This is because eminent leaders are the first people in the organization who can be under astounding pressure to work, and make decisions correctly and they have to have a long-sighted mindset to drive people successfully. Owing to this, if the parents are the leaders, unavoidably their children would become  leaders in the future thanks to inheritance and genetics. For example, as the Donald Trump president is a well-off businessman, the majority of his children are successful leaders in the incorporation of companies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that leadership skills can be developed in intensive practice without inborn qualities. The reason is that one also can become a perfect leader thanks to living in a sufficient environment because they will learn by trial and error and especially they have golden opportunities to practice frequently. Moreover, there are a lot of soft-skill courses  online from around the world about becoming a leader. For instance, current companies usually organize workshops about how to become a brilliant leader to enhance the soft skills of their employees.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why leadership skills can be a god-given talent, but in my opinion, it can be developed through hard-working practice and non-stop learning.'",

There are many phases where a parent-child relationship changes and adulting is one of them. I believe that parents should allow their children to make their own decisions when they grow older. Furthermore, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we talk about childhood, kids are very much connected with their parents and we all have seen small kids who never leave their parents for a second. As time goes on, when they turn into a teenager, they try to maintain distance from their parents as kids are going through hormonal changes during that time. Finally, when children grow as  adults, they again come closer to their parents and try to connect with their parents in a limited way. For example, children will stay away from their parents when they are in grade 10 or 11 and as soon as they turn 24, they again will try to connect with their parents because by that time they have learned many things.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents should have limited involvement in their children's private life as they grow older. Parents should also change their roles from time to time. For example, when children were small the parents used to teach everything to their kids but when they grow older, they should understand their children's boundaries where they should allow them to make their own decisions and guide them whenever required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the role of the parents changes when their children grow older and to save their relationship, parents should allow their children to make their own decisions and guide them whenever it is necessary.'",

To what extent do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is debatable whether the improvement of people\u2019s lives is the most prominent purpose of science or not. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which this view is correct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, humanity inevitably faces various difficulties on the daily and solutions are required to handle these situations. Usage of science is by far the most convenient way of solving these problems; moreover, by carrying out scientific experiments, scientists come to conclusions which lead to accessing data capable of improving day-to-day life. For instance, air pollution has become a great issue nowadays and scientists have taken measures to address this problem. As a result, engines capable of using sources of energy other than fossil fuels have been produced; having a significant effect on reducing the pollution of air and in turn the increase of the quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince the tranquillity of individuals is paramount, it is understandable that the ultimate goal of science would have to be related to their lives;however, other factors are also of high importance; most notably  nature and its species. One particular problem that catches the attention is the extinction of different animal groups leading to the decrease of biodiversity. This matter should not be dismissed as nature is a vast source of data for reaching higher levels of knowledge and science should be used to handle this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as important as the improvement of daily life is, certain matters such as the safety of other living beings should not be overlooked, for they have a noticeable effect on the quality of life.'",

What solution can you\r\n\r\nsuggest?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad attitude among students. it is my contention that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricter rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aims to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, whom they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate in online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events causes momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there is the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screen time, internet availability or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home causes poor manners at school. Yet I believe, if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school.'",

Moreover, international investors from around the globe provide funds for new and upcoming companies that might intrigue them, without the knowledge that they might succeed or not. Thus, I believe that more than just capital support is needed to fully develop plans. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is essential to underscore that practical assistance and guidance are required for a company to fully flourish.

A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits. While it can alleviate  traffic congestion and improve air quality, it also poses a threat to cause overcrowding issues.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the trend ?' \n 'Text': 'Contemporary times see vast numbers of firms shifting to online platforms to arrange meetings. Certain individuals advocate that integrating people on the internet is a beneficial tool, while others believe that it has an extreme drawback for personnel. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of meeting online and provide a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technological investments provide us with well-equipped opportunities, such as comfort and flexibility. A myriad of well-known companies around the world altered their laws about meetings because of the contribution of technology. In this way, although the squad is in a formal meeting to discuss the firm's goals, they are likely to feel relaxed through the computer. For instance, departments could focus properly on their tasks due to some platforms when the earth struggled with the Corona-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the office, several strict rules for individuals are regulated by companies. In other words, staff work under pressure in the domain, yet when they strive to overcome some duties, the squad could arrange a break time at home. For instance, personnel might go somewhere since there is no one observing their actions at home.\r\n\r\nHowever, arranging a meeting on the online platform has some major disadvantages, such as distractions and troubles with connection. Generally, over three individuals live in the same home around the world, so institutes may encounter a myriad of issues created by the environment at home. For instance, a person with offspring is likely to be distracted during the meeting. Consequently, they are unlikely to concentrate on their duties. However, companies ought to consider their procedures for meetings since they have remarkable drawbacks for employees.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though talking with crowds on the online platform seems like an essential method, it has an extremely negative impact on corps' focus and their comfort zones.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is thought by some that  observation during sports is a method that a person can learn about teamwork and strategy, whereas the opponents of this notion take the view that people can learn such skills when they take part in sports. Although I agree that the former idea can be true in some cases, I would argue that the latter  can boost one's knowledge  about these skills. This essay will discuss both views.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some consider that watching sports plays a pivotal role in fostering many aspects of teamwork and strategy. By observing sports people can see what players are doing, and what actions and strategies they are using in order to win the competition. If someone decides to start sports, it may be a good method as in this approach they can learn more about such skills without being injured. Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way they can learn about how to be a part of a team. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy.'",

I would like to discuss both sides in more detail before giving my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous play because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, a young girl had a serious accident when she was climbing because it was raining and the path got slippery, this led to a result of her death. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that the residents should be encouraged to do all sports and activities that they like because not only does it provide a diverse range of play, but it is also the best way for players to explore their abilities as well as their passion to find talented seeds in the sports world. Additionally, this helps to increase the player\u2019s experience. For instance, a person is not good at swimming but she or he may be good at climbing. Thus if they do not have an opportunity to try to climb, they will not discover that they are good at it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to know that dangerous sports should not be agreed to by the law because of their negative consequences, such as causing serious accidents and death but communities should have the freedom to do any play or activity because it motivates more people to join the sports to find talented people.'",

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that traditional learning, presented by teachers, is not replaceable with other technology-driven approaches. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. \r\n\r\nSecondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly assume that common teaching methods will soon be replaced by various types of appealing, novell, and time and money-effective technological trends.'",

So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. \r\n\r\nParents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children.

In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.'",

In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations. In addition, to resist natural disasters, scientists should focus on human beings.'",

I believe this method is completely beneficial because will reduce accidents and provide more chances for us to use our time effectively.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, nowadays cars have a driver and a person has to do this responsibility, although, the next generation of cars will not need a person to work and this reformat will help humankind to use that time for other tasks. For example, reading the news, calling a friend or family member or doing simpler tasks such as relaxation. Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way. For instance , tesla cars have a program that can measure other drivers' habits and estimate their next move also they can share information with other cars and this algoritem is able to avoid dangerous activities and maximize safety.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, drivers have a large impact on industries and have different responsibilities if we eliminate their jobs, they will be unsatisfied and also face  many problems. However, any new technology needs some staff and equipment so governments can prepare some courses to teach those people to be adapted to new methods and they can fill this gap just with some education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, In my opinion, I totally agree with the replacement of drivers with new technology because it will help  humankind and reduce dangers.

Would you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, It is apparent that advertisements play a significant part in human daily lives. They inform us about products and services, and can shape our preferences. However, they also can influence vulnerable groups like kids. In light of that, It is the reason why it caused some people to think that it is best to avoid targeting children in advertisements. Personally speaking, I believe that advertisements should not target children, as it is crucial to protect them from harmful marketing practices. \r\n\r\nCertainly, choosing to target children in marketing may not lead to direct profits for marketers because children do not have the ability to make independent purchasing decisions. Since they rely on their parents or guardians for buying products, the impact on sales may be limited. Moreover, Advertising aimed at children also puts pressure on parents to fulfil their children\u2019s expectations \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children offspring may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked. Fancy advertising techniques can lead to numerous unhealthy habits, such as excessive consumption of snacks or drinks, which can have long-term health issues. Companies and governments need to be careful and make sure ads are fair, especially for kids.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are different opinions on whether marketers should target children in advertisements, I believe that advertisements should be limited, especially when it comes to targeting children.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.\r\n\r\nOne pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nTo foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action. By addressing the pervasive influence of technology, promoting outdoor experiential learning in educational settings, and fostering community-based initiatives, it is conceivable to rekindle young individuals' affinity with nature. Ultimately, bridging the gap between young people and the natural environment is imperative for fostering a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the world around us.'",

The key to many problems humans face is science for reducing hunger, finding new cures, and creating a better economy. However, there is a strong argument that the public should be the priority and the essential goal of science is to make humans live better. This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the development of science benefits people\u2019s lives. Many invented cures and discoveries of technology bring people to a new era. For example, a hundred year before, someone who was infected by the flu close to died since there was no knowledge about the cure and how to prevent it. However, science has been growing, scientists invented the vaccine, and the public nowadays can live side by side with the flu. As a result, science saved many lives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, science aims to broaden people\u2019s knowledge to be aware of the environment. Many nations in this world do not have a good geography. Africa and some parts of Asia have severe drought, and most of them cannot produce their own food because of the bad soil. In addition, scientists discovered how to make some vegetation suitable for this condition, and they did it. For instance, In Indonesia, there is a place with poor land conditions, but with some experiments on vegetation, nowadays, they have poor land conditions, but with some experiments on greens, nowadays, they are able to grow some plants that suit poor soil. This helps society to improve their lives by growing their own food.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the goal of science is helpful for the community.

Firstly, childhood is given to a person once only. Children should live their childhoods, they should hang out with their friends, they should play outdoor games with their peers. Children should not be seen as  figures who should be responsible for many things at an early age.

Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The disparity in salaries between senior positions and junior workers within the same company has sparked debate regarding its justification. While some argue that this wage gap is unjustified and perpetuates inequality, others contend that it is warranted based on factors such as experience, expertise, and leadership responsibilities. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on this matter.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the salary gap between senior and junior positions argue that it is unfair and undermines principles of equality and meritocracy. They contend that younger workers often possess comparable skills and qualifications to their senior counterparts and should be compensated accordingly. Additionally, maintaining a significant wage differential may demotivate junior employees and hinder their career progression, leading to dissatisfaction and turnover within the organization.\r\n\r\nHowever, proponents of higher salaries for senior positions argue that remuneration should reflect the level of responsibility, experience, and value brought to the organization. Senior employees typically have years of experience and expertise in their field, along with leadership roles that entail greater accountability and decision-making authority. As such, they argue that higher salaries for senior positions are justified as a recognition of these contributions and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while experience and expertise are undoubtedly valuable, the extent of the wage gap between senior and junior positions should be scrutinized to ensure fairness and transparency. Organizations should implement clear and objective criteria for determining salaries, taking into account factors such as performance, qualifications, and market standards. Additionally, efforts should be made to provide opportunities for career advancement and skill development for junior employees, thereby bridging the gap between senior and junior positions over time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate over salary differentials between senior and junior positions reflects competing priorities regarding fairness, meritocracy, and organizational value. While experience and leadership responsibilities warrant higher salaries for senior positions, it is essential to ensure that wage differentials are justified and transparent. By fostering a culture of equity and opportunity, organizations can promote employee satisfaction and long-term success.'",

What problems will this cause? What can be done to solve these problems?' \n 'Text': 'The preservation of old towns and cities presents a unique set of challenges in today's rapidly evolving urban landscape. While these historical settlements may have been well-suited and livable for people in previous centuries, they often face various problems in the modern era. In this essay, I will discuss the problems caused by the preservation of old towns and cities and propose solutions to address these challenges.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary problems associated with old towns and cities is outdated infrastructure and urban planning. Many of these settlements were designed for a smaller population and less vehicular traffic, leading to congestion, inadequate transportation systems, and deteriorating infrastructure. Additionally, historic buildings may lack modern amenities and compliance with safety and accessibility standards, posing risks to residents and visitors alike.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the preservation of old towns and cities can exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and gentrification. As these areas become popular tourist destinations or desirable neighborhoods for affluent residents, property values rise, displacing long-term residents and eroding the cultural fabric of the community. This phenomenon often leads to the loss of affordable housing and the marginalization of lower-income residents.\r\n\r\nTo address these problems, proactive measures must be taken to balance preservation with modernization and inclusivity. Firstly, investments should be made in upgrading infrastructure and urban amenities to meet the needs of residents and visitors while preserving the historical character of the area. This may involve improving transportation networks, restoring historic buildings, and enhancing public spaces for recreational and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, policies should be implemented to promote equitable development and affordable housing in old towns and cities. This could include the preservation of affordable housing stock, incentivizing mixed-income development, and providing support for local businesses and community initiatives. Engaging residents and stakeholders in the decision-making process is also crucial to ensure that preservation efforts are inclusive and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the preservation of old towns and cities presents challenges related to infrastructure, gentrification, and socioeconomic disparities, proactive measures can mitigate these issues. By investing in modernization while preserving historical integrity and promoting equitable development, old towns and cities can continue to thrive as vibrant and livable communities for generations to come.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'very few school children learn about the value of money and how to look after it, yet this is s critical skill that should be taught as part of the school curriculum. Do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The lack of emphasis on teaching children about the value of money and financial management within the school curriculum is a glaring oversight with significant ramifications. I firmly agree that financial literacy is a critical skill that should be integrated into the educational framework from an early age. In this essay, I will elaborate on the importance of financial education in schools and discuss whether the current state of affairs represents a positive or negative development.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, instilling financial literacy in children equips them with essential life skills necessary for navigating the complexities of the modern world. Understanding concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions and cultivate responsible financial habits. Without proper guidance, young adults may fall prey to financial pitfalls such as overspending, debt accumulation, and lack of savings, leading to long-term financial instability and stress.\r\n\r\nMoreover, integrating financial education into the school curriculum promotes socioeconomic equality by leveling the playing field and providing all students, regardless of their background, with the tools to achieve financial independence. By fostering a culture of financial responsibility and empowerment, schools can help mitigate the cycle of poverty and equip future generations with the skills necessary to build a secure financial future for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, financial literacy education aligns with the broader goals of education in fostering holistic development and preparing students for adulthood. Just as schools teach subjects like mathematics and language arts to impart essential cognitive skills, teaching financial literacy ensures that students develop the practical skills needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected global economy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the absence of financial literacy education in schools represents a significant oversight with far-reaching implications. Integrating financial education into the curriculum is imperative to empower students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the intricacies of personal finance and achieve long-term financial well-being. Therefore, I strongly believe that making financial literacy a core component of the school curriculum is not only necessary but also a profoundly positive development for society as a whole.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead of going directly to university.\r\n\r\nDo the advantages of this for their study outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, students taking a gap year are very popular for several reasons. This situation has more advantages than disadvantages.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a risk of losing focus on long-term educational goals, as hands-on work experience or the lure of travel can shift priorities away from academic ambitions. In addition, a break from academic learning can lead to a loss of study habits and momentum, making it difficult to readjust to academic rigor. For example, a child who graduated with good grades may lose passion for his or her academics. However, I believe this can be overcome if one has strong ambition and decisions from the start.\r\n\r\nTaking a gap year can help individuals clear their heads and gain a better understanding of their career interests and aspirations, leading to more informed decisions regarding their academic and professional pursuits. In addition, traveling can broaden one's horizons, offering exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking, which can enhance creativity and adaptability in future studies. Finally, gaining real-world experience can provide practical skills that are not taught in the classroom, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. As an illustration, a student who volunteers and contributes to the community will certainly be useful in college life later on.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following the above statements, I believe that the advantages of postponing college outweigh the disadvantages because it can prepare students well and thoroughly. On the other hand, if some teenagers are able to stay in the direction they set from the beginning and their ambitions, I think the disadvantages will be lost.'",

I am convinced that families where the mother has a job have a number of benefits, and they outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I plan to spot my perspectives and substantiate them with examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this phenomenon has a few disadvantages and the foremost among them is the decreased amount of care, attention, and time that a parent, staying at home, devotes to his child. Obviously, the shortage of parental love and care can cause self-doubt in a kid and, as a result, harm him. For example, I faced such a situation when I went to work 4 months after the birth of my first child and was forced to hire a nurse. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in many situations, it is highly challenging to do a standard living when only one parent works. Needless to say, two-income families have more money and, as a result, more financial stability that leads to prosperity and a comfortable atmosphere in the home. Additionally, in these conditions, there is always an opportunity to find solutions to properly manage children's activities such as numerous kindergartens where they could remain safe until the mother and father are in the office. Moreover, having a half-time job is also a possible scenario in which all family members can be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the mother's absence can be detrimental to her kid, I still believe that adding extra income to the family budget can help improve the lives of the offspring.'",

Some people think that it would be better for the environment and economy if people ate only the local food produced by farmers.' \n 'Text': 'There is a common argument that, as advocated, each person needs to consume their local products in order to save money and protect the environment. I strongly agree, and I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nEach region, based on its geographical area, can afford all their people's needs. Along with this fact, it is obvious that our bodies are adapted to the place that we leave. While we can attune our bodies to weather conditions, we can do the same in the absence of some food and use other products instead. As our ancestors in the past were doing the same, they couldn\u2019t transfer veggies or foods to another place, and even they couldn\u2019t save them for their future. So, they tried to find new products to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, in order to deliver food from the producer to the consumer, we unintentionally cause a lot of damage to nature. For instance, the amount of gasoline that must be burned, the waste that is produced, or the preservatives that are used will cause serious damage. Another drawback of it is that people can\u2019t access fresh foods. In the long run, not using healthy food will have dangerous consequences for the body. You may pay a lot for the product, but most of this cost will be due to the cost of shipping and packaging, not the quality of it.

However, Motivation does matter; therefore, in rare cases, it is up to the judge to decide the reason behind doing something illegal and evaluate the circumstances.

Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that it would be  better for children to  live in the countryside rather than in a big city.In my opinion, I completely disagree with this point of view and I believe that the advantages grow up in the city  far outweigh the advantages of the countryside,which can be supported by the reasons as follows.\r\n\r\nFirstly and foremost,  there are multiple inconveniences for  children living in the suburbs.Obviously, with the development of the economy,  subsequently, there exists an imbalance between the city centre and the suburbs, not to mention the countryside, including not only the level of education, healthcare,and entertainment infrastructures  but also the opportunities to get into touch with different experiences. For example, in the big city, the latest and most sophisticated technologies would help children avoid  various diseases. At the same time, the advanced educational systems and resources would provide broadened knowledge and insights, which can help youngsters have a leading stage compared to the country's peers. What's more, the existence of vibrant entertainment can provide an impressive and delightful childhood duration. It is important to the mental health of adolescents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, keeping children away from the countryside would ensure safety. It is undeniable that lacking  monitors may have a potential impact on  crime. Furthermore,the limited safeguard methods are another dangerous factor that would jeopardise the life of any individual.For instance,once there are some arsons who commit a crime and fire a house, there are few emergency methods or tools to stamp it off. Thus, the children have no chance of living in a completely safe circumstance.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that it would be better to let children spend their childhood in a big city,not only for the more advanced technologies, but more importantly ,safety.In this case,governments and families should devote sufficient efforts to make it come true.'",

Moreover, some parents argue that maths is not important, whereas some believe it is a fundamental part of education. Thus, this essay will discuss the cognitive impact of mathematics, while also considering the educational obligation that schools have to accommodate all types of learners. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers for various aspects of a child's cognitive development. For example, a study done at Harvard University found that mathematical concepts are found in everyday objects, and that the average person unknowingly uses mathematics about 80% a day when identifying objects or solving complex problems. Furthermore, mathematics is vital to advance technology and perform breakthrough inventions that can benefit the future. Thus, it is essential to acknowledge that maths plays a momentous role on someone's intellectual abilities and can be considered as a fundamental part of education. \r\n\r\nSecondly, all educational institutions have a moral standard to accommodate different students. To illustrate this, High School Sunrise do not include maths as part of their curriculum, because 65% of their students have a below average IQ. Given this, it is imperative that schools still enhance learning, even towards children who have intellectual disabilities. In addition to this, it is notable that mathematics is unimportant in cases like these, however, if a student has the cognitive skills to do maths, then it should be encouraged. Hence, maths is important in some cases, but there are exceptions where it is not important. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is my contention that schools should encourage mathematics where possible, but  keep in mind that not all students have the cognitive skills to master the subject. If students are encouraged to develop according to their abilities, then a more balanced lifestyle might occur in the foreseeable future.'",

This essay discusses why the benefits of this phenomenon, such as convenience and safety, surpass the drawbacks of individuals sometimes having technical difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe first merit of using bank applications instead of physical cash is that it is more convenient for people. This is because carrying just one piece of equipment instead of a bunch of cedules and coins is more practical for most people's lifestyles. For example, many individuals have stopped carrying physical money because they may need more than what they have on hand. Therefore, when people opt for paying apps they have more flexibility to spend the amount they need or want.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is safer to use phone apps instead of physical money. This is due to the security installed into these applications, in case they end up in the wrong hands, while cedules can be easily lost or stolen. For instance, new studies say that travellers who carry physical cash are eight times more susceptible to getting robbed. In comparison, people who only get their cellphones robbed often lose less money, due to apps' cryptography security.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also a downside to using mobile applications as the major payment method. This is the difficulty that individuals sometimes experience when no internet is available. Officers usually recommend travellers carry a bit of cash in case their mobile data runs out or their phones' batteries shut down. If this happens, people may find themselves in a different country without any monetary resources, which can cause serious issues and time wasted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main merits of using bank apps as a payment method such as the practicality and the security, outweigh the negative aspect of people sometimes having technical problems due to internet connection or running out of battery. Furthermore, these issues can be solved by looking for free wifi establishments and also, carrying portable charges in case needed.'",

For example, more than 45% of employees who are working in my company have anxiety because of heavy duties and a lot of pressure.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in some people's minds, there is a concept that when you are living as a teenager you will have a happy life, while others think in the opposite way where they think adult life would be a much happier time. But, children do not have any concerns in their life, so, they will be much happier and more passionate about life.'",

I totally agree that free access to these websites lays the foundation for great interest among people.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, technological advancements in the future can enable people to access easily to different sources of information in the Internet, and encourage them not to purchase printed products. News companies and writers may give the preference to share the online version of their newspapers and books through the Internet without demanding money in order to reach an increasing number of readers and become more popular. This is because, nowadays many individuals have greater opportunities to use online websites rather in than the past, and a range of chances become more accessible every day. Therefore, I agree that they can draw the attention of users by making their resources completely free.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the owners of these websites can earn a large amount of money from the social media companies with the help of views and subscribers which do not demand certain payment. These earnings which websites gain are getting larger because of the growing number of users, and thus owners will not need to sell their newspapers and books. So, both admins and users can benefit from the upsides of the online sources in terms of income.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some people consider that traditional ways of reading newspapers and books will maintain their popularity, I believe that people are likely to prefer online methods in order to avoid paying money.'",

Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of this' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, the income from tourism has become increasingly prominent. While some experts believe that tourism can benefit the economy of a country, others say that it alleviates small communities. Personally, I strongly advocate for the former view. Thus, this essay aims to explore the benefits and drawbacks that tourism has on countries. \r\n\r\nOne notable benefit of tourism is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of an economy. This trend is twofold; touristic attractions provide financial aid for the transportation and hospitality sectors of a country, which overall impacts the GDP of an economy. For instance, the city of Cape Town is the richest city in South Africa due to Table Mountain, which is a momentous destination that attracts individuals from around the world. Given this, restaurants, hotels, local craft shops and transportation systems have gained significantly from this phenomenon. Therefore, it is my opinion that tourism is an advantage for all countries. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are merits to this trend, it fails to support peaceful towns. To illustrate this, Margate Beach has become extremely popular, which resulted in local residents to relocate. Furthermore, towns that has become succumbed to tourism, often neglect the peacefulness that once resided in the town. With more tourists in the area, traffic congestions worsen and the area becomes overpopulated. Hence, while there are immensive benefits, tourism can also disturb the lives of locals.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it can cause a disturbance for some native communities, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If tourism continues to grow, then more economies might benefit.'",

Some people think that music can be beneficial in gathering people together from different backgrounds. I totally agree with this point of view for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, music can help people to communicate easily with others who have different cultures. For example, music can be used by a person in small talk to introduce himself or herself. If someone listens to music that is popular around the globe, he or she can comment about it on social media and also can see others' comments. As a result, people from different areas can be friends by sharing their ideas about the same songs.\r\n\r\nThe second reason why I think so is that concerts can help bring people from various cultures into one area and help them to meet new friends. For instance, the young generation has a big interest in concerts from popular singers and they mainly go abroad for these concerts. If someone travels to another country to participate in concerts, he or she can meet local residents and  share his or her own culture and also learn the local traditions of the country. However, this can lead to cultural exchange and help people to hone their minds.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into account, in my opinion, music can help people to learn about different cultures as they can share their ideas by using social media tools and also taking part in concerts can be a good way for people to meet new friends and learn more things about their cultures and traditions.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Spoken communication is more powerful than written communication. To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: orally and in written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people.'",

In my opinion, they search for this for many reasons, maybe out of curiosity, or for their own safety. To help find answers, they should ask the elderly in the neighbourhoods. \r\n\r\nSome people done some research on stories of their homes simply for the sake of curiosity.

This makes the residents of those buildings can\u2019t help to find out more about them, such as when they were built, who lived there, and why they look the way they do.\r\n\r\nThere are also people who delve into the past to ensure their safety. There are still many people who believe in superstitions like ghosts. Particularly in the old houses that withstand years of different generations of ownership. There is a possibility that suicide or murder happened all those years ago, and the current occupant is afraid the lingering souls will come for them and disturb their peaceful lives.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the best solutions for people to explore, is to reach out to the senior residents in their neighbourhood.  Some of them have lived in the same place all their lives. They have seen all the changes happening around them. They have witnessed others coming and going. Talking with them should be able to uncover some intriguing stories from the past regarding one\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, curiosity and motivation to find if there is a supernatural phenomenon in their house are two possible reasons why people want to investigate their house\u2019s history.

What is your opinion?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, selfishness has become increasingly prominent. Some argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the lack of caring for others, which alleviates kindness. It is my contention that kind-heartedness can improve mental health and promote adequate standards for future generations, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of mental well-being. For example, psychologist Edwin Charles mentions that the brain releases large amounts of dopamine when showing kindness, which in return stimulates one's brain to be happier. Moreover, almost 80% of suicides are caused by a lack of kindness. Thus, without even knowing it, being friendly to a stranger can decrease depression and trauma for them. Therefore, it is evident that pure actions might both improve someone's own mentality and others. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is essential to underscore the impact that modern actions could have on humans in the foreseeable future. To illustrate this, anthropologist Kathy Steward explains that 50% of an individual's  actions are influenced by their parents. Given this, the concatenation of moral values and standards that are being taught to today's children could be learned by their offspring, which continues the cycle of rudeness; unless it is stopped and replaced with kindness. Hence, humbleness can create a beter life for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is notable that kindness can increase mental health and promote the quality of life. It is my opinion that if kindness is disseminated throughout the globe, then the lives of all humans can benefit.'",

They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are required to make people recycle more of their waste?' \n 'Text': 'In today's society, environmental sustainability has witnessed transformative innovation. With the rise of environmental awareness, the question of  whether waste recycling in households is sufficient has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts argue that governments should enact laws to regulate and encourage recycling. From my perspective, while laws may help improve recycling rates, they are not the sole solution to increasing recycling.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that legal mandates can effectively raise awareness and encourage compliance with recycling practices. When recycling is legally required, individuals are more likely to take it seriously and incorporate it into their daily routines. Moreover, enforcement mechanisms such as fines or penalties can incentivize compliance and deter individuals from neglecting their recycling responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on legislation to promote recycling overlooks the importance of education and public engagement. Laws can set the framework for recycling initiatives, but they may not address underlying issues such as lack of awareness or motivation. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines legal mandates with educational campaigns and community involvement is essential for long-term success in promoting recycling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, enforcing recycling laws may pose logistical challenges and strain resources, especially in regions with limited infrastructure or economic constraints. In such cases, alternative strategies such as incentivizing recycling through rewards or subsidies may be more effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while laws can be a valuable tool in promoting recycling, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes education, public engagement, and incentives. By adopting a multifaceted approach, governments can create a culture of sustainability and encourage responsible waste management practices among citizens.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'While some claim that leadership skill is an inborn quality of an individual, others believe that anyone also become a leader in the future thanks to practice. From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why leadership skill is a god-given talent is because a leader is the most important person in an organization or company due to their inborn qualities. This is because eminent leaders are the first people in the organization who can be under astounding pressure to work, and make decisions correctly and they have to have a long-sighted mindset to drive people successfully. Owing to this, if the parents are the leaders, unavoidably their children would become  leaders in the future thanks to inheritance and genetics. For example, as the Donald Trump president is a well-off businessman, the majority of his children are successful leaders in the incorporation of companies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that leadership skills can be developed in intensive practice without inborn qualities. The reason is that one also can become a perfect leader thanks to living in a sufficient environment because they will learn by trial and error and especially they have golden opportunities to practice frequently. Moreover, there are a lot of soft-skill courses  online from around the world about becoming a leader. For instance, current companies usually organize workshops about how to become a brilliant leader to enhance the soft skills of their employees.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why leadership skills can be a god-given talent, but in my opinion, it can be developed through hard-working practice and non-stop learning.'",

There are many phases where a parent-child relationship changes and adulting is one of them. I believe that parents should allow their children to make their own decisions when they grow older. Furthermore, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we talk about childhood, kids are very much connected with their parents and we all have seen small kids who never leave their parents for a second. As time goes on, when they turn into a teenager, they try to maintain distance from their parents as kids are going through hormonal changes during that time. Finally, when children grow as  adults, they again come closer to their parents and try to connect with their parents in a limited way. For example, children will stay away from their parents when they are in grade 10 or 11 and as soon as they turn 24, they again will try to connect with their parents because by that time they have learned many things.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents should have limited involvement in their children's private life as they grow older. Parents should also change their roles from time to time. For example, when children were small the parents used to teach everything to their kids but when they grow older, they should understand their children's boundaries where they should allow them to make their own decisions and guide them whenever required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the role of the parents changes when their children grow older and to save their relationship, parents should allow their children to make their own decisions and guide them whenever it is necessary.'",

To what extent do you agree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is debatable whether the improvement of people\u2019s lives is the most prominent purpose of science or not. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which this view is correct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, humanity inevitably faces various difficulties on the daily and solutions are required to handle these situations. Usage of science is by far the most convenient way of solving these problems; moreover, by carrying out scientific experiments, scientists come to conclusions which lead to accessing data capable of improving day-to-day life. For instance, air pollution has become a great issue nowadays and scientists have taken measures to address this problem. As a result, engines capable of using sources of energy other than fossil fuels have been produced; having a significant effect on reducing the pollution of air and in turn the increase of the quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince the tranquillity of individuals is paramount, it is understandable that the ultimate goal of science would have to be related to their lives;however, other factors are also of high importance; most notably  nature and its species. One particular problem that catches the attention is the extinction of different animal groups leading to the decrease of biodiversity. This matter should not be dismissed as nature is a vast source of data for reaching higher levels of knowledge and science should be used to handle this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as important as the improvement of daily life is, certain matters such as the safety of other living beings should not be overlooked, for they have a noticeable effect on the quality of life.'",

What solution can you\r\n\r\nsuggest?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad attitude among students. it is my contention that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricter rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aims to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, whom they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate in online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events causes momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there is the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screen time, internet availability or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home causes poor manners at school. Yet I believe, if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school.'",

Some motivation, some effort, and some dreaming are all that people need to succeed. Learning is easier in the pre-middle years. if someone starts a career.

For example, a news reporter in New York disseminates that AI Inco in China wires over one million dollars a year to Samsung to develop Artificial Intelligence for smart devices. Moreover, international investors from around the globe provide funds for new and upcoming companies that might intrigue them, without the knowledge that they might succeed or not. Thus, I believe that more than just capital support is needed to fully develop plans. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is essential to underscore that practical assistance and guidance are required for a company to fully flourish.

As a result, the students' figure increased dramatically and making the distinction between genders is an ineffective method because the number of universities  should be doubled and this is completely a waste of money. Additionally, the figure of teachers will be faced with a shortage and there will be a large gap for educators and the quality of studies will not remain the same , consequently, there will be a significant decrease in community knowledge.

The debate over whether cities should make public transportation free of charge in metropolises has been longstanding,with a majority of people praising the benefits that it will bring to the cities. It is my contention that while benefits such as less traffic and improved air quality will be fulfilled afterwards, I would say the drawbacks are solely limited to the accumulation of crowding in alternative transportation vehicles due to the growth. \r\n\r\nMaking city transportation costless indeed has several advantages, and one of the most noticeable ones is alleviating congestion in capital cities. Many key cities around the world are facing the challenge of dealing with a large number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to long congestion lines. By providing free transportation, with support from government agencies, citizens are more likely to choose public vehicles for their travel needs. A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits. While it can alleviate  traffic congestion and improve air quality, it also poses a threat to cause overcrowding issues.'",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the trend ?' \n 'Text': 'Contemporary times see vast numbers of firms shifting to online platforms to arrange meetings. Certain individuals advocate that integrating people on the internet is a beneficial tool, while others believe that it has an extreme drawback for personnel. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of meeting online and provide a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technological investments provide us with well-equipped opportunities, such as comfort and flexibility. A myriad of well-known companies around the world altered their laws about meetings because of the contribution of technology. In this way, although the squad is in a formal meeting to discuss the firm's goals, they are likely to feel relaxed through the computer. For instance, departments could focus properly on their tasks due to some platforms when the earth struggled with the Corona-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the office, several strict rules for individuals are regulated by companies. In other words, staff work under pressure in the domain, yet when they strive to overcome some duties, the squad could arrange a break time at home. For instance, personnel might go somewhere since there is no one observing their actions at home.\r\n\r\nHowever, arranging a meeting on the online platform has some major disadvantages, such as distractions and troubles with connection. Generally, over three individuals live in the same home around the world, so institutes may encounter a myriad of issues created by the environment at home. For instance, a person with offspring is likely to be distracted during the meeting. Consequently, they are unlikely to concentrate on their duties. However, companies ought to consider their procedures for meetings since they have remarkable drawbacks for employees.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though talking with crowds on the online platform seems like an essential method, it has an extremely negative impact on corps' focus and their comfort zones.'",

Discuss both views and give your opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is thought by some that  observation during sports is a method that a person can learn about teamwork and strategy, whereas the opponents of this notion take the view that people can learn such skills when they take part in sports. Although I agree that the former idea can be true in some cases, I would argue that the latter  can boost one's knowledge  about these skills. This essay will discuss both views.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some consider that watching sports plays a pivotal role in fostering many aspects of teamwork and strategy. By observing sports people can see what players are doing, and what actions and strategies they are using in order to win the competition. If someone decides to start sports, it may be a good method as in this approach they can learn more about such skills without being injured. Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way they can learn about how to be a part of a team. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy.'",

I would like to discuss both sides in more detail before giving my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous play because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, a young girl had a serious accident when she was climbing because it was raining and the path got slippery, this led to a result of her death. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that the residents should be encouraged to do all sports and activities that they like because not only does it provide a diverse range of play, but it is also the best way for players to explore their abilities as well as their passion to find talented seeds in the sports world. Additionally, this helps to increase the player\u2019s experience. For instance, a person is not good at swimming but she or he may be good at climbing. Thus if they do not have an opportunity to try to climb, they will not discover that they are good at it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to know that dangerous sports should not be agreed to by the law because of their negative consequences, such as causing serious accidents and death but communities should have the freedom to do any play or activity because it motivates more people to join the sports to find talented people.'",

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'It is often argued that traditional learning, presented by teachers, is not replaceable with other technology-driven approaches. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. \r\n\r\nSecondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly assume that common teaching methods will soon be replaced by various types of appealing, novell, and time and money-effective technological trends.'",

So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. \r\n\r\nParents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children.

Otherwise, if this is not respected, it can damage the contact between both of them.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, children await autonomy, emancipation and living on their own to be happy in life . If parents are too invasive, children become distant and the link could be broken . \r\n\r\nTo summarize, whilst parents have to give love and respect to their children to build a strong relationship, they also have to not be too invasive in order to keep a strong link between both of them.'",

In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.'",

In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations. In addition, to resist natural disasters, scientists should focus on human beings.'",

I believe this method is completely beneficial because will reduce accidents and provide more chances for us to use our time effectively.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, nowadays cars have a driver and a person has to do this responsibility, although, the next generation of cars will not need a person to work and this reformat will help humankind to use that time for other tasks. For example, reading the news, calling a friend or family member or doing simpler tasks such as relaxation. Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way. For instance , tesla cars have a program that can measure other drivers' habits and estimate their next move also they can share information with other cars and this algoritem is able to avoid dangerous activities and maximize safety.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, drivers have a large impact on industries and have different responsibilities if we eliminate their jobs, they will be unsatisfied and also face  many problems. However, any new technology needs some staff and equipment so governments can prepare some courses to teach those people to be adapted to new methods and they can fill this gap just with some education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, In my opinion, I totally agree with the replacement of drivers with new technology because it will help  humankind and reduce dangers.

Would you agree or disagree with this statement?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, It is apparent that advertisements play a significant part in human daily lives. They inform us about products and services, and can shape our preferences. However, they also can influence vulnerable groups like kids. In light of that, It is the reason why it caused some people to think that it is best to avoid targeting children in advertisements. Personally speaking, I believe that advertisements should not target children, as it is crucial to protect them from harmful marketing practices. \r\n\r\nCertainly, choosing to target children in marketing may not lead to direct profits for marketers because children do not have the ability to make independent purchasing decisions. Since they rely on their parents or guardians for buying products, the impact on sales may be limited. Moreover, Advertising aimed at children also puts pressure on parents to fulfil their children\u2019s expectations \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children offspring may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked. Fancy advertising techniques can lead to numerous unhealthy habits, such as excessive consumption of snacks or drinks, which can have long-term health issues. Companies and governments need to be careful and make sure ads are fair, especially for kids.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are different opinions on whether marketers should target children in advertisements, I believe that advertisements should be limited, especially when it comes to targeting children.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.\r\n\r\nOne pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nTo foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action. By addressing the pervasive influence of technology, promoting outdoor experiential learning in educational settings, and fostering community-based initiatives, it is conceivable to rekindle young individuals' affinity with nature. Ultimately, bridging the gap between young people and the natural environment is imperative for fostering a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the world around us.'",

The key to many problems humans face is science for reducing hunger, finding new cures, and creating a better economy. However, there is a strong argument that the public should be the priority and the essential goal of science is to make humans live better. This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the development of science benefits people\u2019s lives. Many invented cures and discoveries of technology bring people to a new era. For example, a hundred year before, someone who was infected by the flu close to died since there was no knowledge about the cure and how to prevent it. However, science has been growing, scientists invented the vaccine, and the public nowadays can live side by side with the flu. As a result, science saved many lives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, science aims to broaden people\u2019s knowledge to be aware of the environment. Many nations in this world do not have a good geography. Africa and some parts of Asia have severe drought, and most of them cannot produce their own food because of the bad soil. In addition, scientists discovered how to make some vegetation suitable for this condition, and they did it. For instance, In Indonesia, there is a place with poor land conditions, but with some experiments on vegetation, nowadays, they have poor land conditions, but with some experiments on greens, nowadays, they are able to grow some plants that suit poor soil. This helps society to improve their lives by growing their own food.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the goal of science is helpful for the community.

Firstly, childhood is given to a person once only. Children should live their childhoods, they should hang out with their friends, they should play outdoor games with their peers. Children should not be seen as  figures who should be responsible for many things at an early age.

By repairing the roads where they are damaged, the speed of traffic would be increased. Also, using more efficient lights at crossroads and proper speed bumps could prevent future accidents, which are one of the main reasons causing gridlock. In addition, increasing the number of paths available for citizens or widening them might be a significant solution. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the government can impose a charge on drivers entering crowded areas during rush hour. This would be highly beneficial because many people who are not in a hurry or shouldn't be necessarily in these areas may choose another path. Plus, charging drivers will raise money for the governments that can be used to improve the roads and build bridges and by-paths. For example, in Tehran, drivers who enter the traffic area should pay a fine, and this is spent on the improvement of roads and the growth of urbanization.\r\n\r\nFinally, governments can improve the quality of public transportation so that more individuals may be encouraged to avoid private cars. Making public transportation more convenient and decreasing their delays, with precise timetabling, will attract more citizens to use them. Moreover, increasing the subway and bus station networks would enhance accessibility to different zones of the city. As a result, those dwellers who see themselves as responsible for resolving the problems of their fellow citizens and similarly reducing environmental issues will cooperate with the government, making their city more prosperous and thriving.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, considering gridlock a significant difficulty for society members in metropolises, steps could be taken by both governments and individuals to lessen the problem.'",

This is especially so if population growth and the number of unemployed people place a serious burden on land and housing that only high-rise buildings, such as skyscrapers, can handle. As a result, more and more people own their accommodation and have an official occupation, whilst constructing more similar superstructures in the urbanizational era. Take China as a pertinent example, where most architectural styles are homogenized by state-of-the-art methods from foreign nations during the globalization period for working purposes and housing zones.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this phenomenon is detrimental to the variety of national cultures. Although some people agree with the erection of high-rise architecture, the majority of citizens desire to maintain a tradition that is distinctive from another community. If all of the infrastructures were identical to each other between nations, the culture would lack enhancement and richness, causing the disappearance shortly without any solutions to preservation. Vietnamese houses are prime examples, where the plenty of thatched cottages in the past do not exist anymore because of no conservation and made way for the fashionable and large building structures in the urban and willing to enlarge in the rural designated areas.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the circumstance of modern society improved by the innovative architectural building stems from international collaboration with the aim of dealing with the global populous problems. Nonetheless, spending money on these new building constructions brings a severe threat to the traditional variety.'",

I agree with 2 different statements equally.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a number of training and rehabilitation programs should be offered to the majority of offenders, because they may contribute positively to the country's economy in the future if inmates take  advantage of these opportunities. For example, individuals who are provided with business and software education may broaden their horizons and increase their important skills such as communication and programming. Consequently, inmates will be able to work in different industries to meet basic needs and pay  taxes, and bills, which will be beneficial to the country's financial budget increasing overall revenues.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, long-term prison sentences pave the way for the public to feel a sense of safety and protection. To be specific, criminals are locked away and by keeping offenders off the street, they cannot commit a crime. For example, if there were no prisons, many dangerous consequences, such as re-offending, may happen in society. Furthermore, it is more effective when people are aware of exact punishments to avoid crimes, so the government has to put convicts behind bars.

On the contrary, others see it as necessary for the development of young people. In my opinion, children should not work because it can lead to exploitation and the contrary due to the fact that it helps them take on some responsibility. \r\n\r\nSome people believe that youngsters should not get involved in  jobs because companies can easily exploit them. Furthermore, youngsters are a fragile population that does not have, yet, the capacity to detect when they are in an abusive working environment. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the law allows minors to be financially paid for their effort. Consequently, this right has been used abusively and has led 22 million offspring to be exploited by transnational corporations such as Teleton that use these workers to obtain cobalt from the mines. \r\n\r\nMinors should work since it allows them to take on responsibility at a young age, allowing them to be quickly performant in their future careers. In addition, an individual learns what is important in a company and how to present himself as someone who can be trusted. For instance, the University of Connecticut  conducted in 2022, illustrated that 70% of the time, the best employees in American companies like Google have had their first work experience at the age of 15 being very productive for both youngsters and the company.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, even if children can end up exploited, I believe that they should be allowed to have a job because the responsibilities they get from their first working experience will help them in perfectly start a strong and stable career.'",

What problems can this cause? How can these problems be resolved' \n 'Text': 'In recent times, visits to isolated and fragile ecosystems through eco-tourism have witnessed a surge in popularity in many countries. As a result, local communities and habitats are facing a wide range of problems. This essay will explore various issues related to eco-tourism and a number of potential solutions in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nBy analyzing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost issue related to green tourism is the disruption of the cultural heritage of native societies. By embracing a large number of tourists from different countries, a local group of people is getting influenced by international traditions, which is resulting in the destruction of their own culture and values. For instance, a native society of Kerala (India) has altered their style of cultural dance in order to attract more visitors. However, they are neglecting the fact that this initiative could result in the loss of their personal identity. Moreover, trips to delicate spots also affect the stability of biological diversity, which causes environmental degradation. By providing a large number of camping and hiking sites to travellers, the government is compromising the health of our ecosphere. More visitors result in more pollution, which leads to additional disturbance to flora and fauna species.\r\n\r\nBy seeing the problem with a brighter mind, a wide range of solutions is available. To mitigate this problem, higher authorities and the forest department should impose strict laws in order to preserve the native customs and biosphere. In addition to this, domestic groups should take appropriate steps to shed some light on awareness and the power of education among community groups to teach them not to be influenced by the colours of another country's traditions.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, eco-tourism has the potential to boost the country's economy, but issues in relation to this, such as cultural disruption and instability of the ecosystem cannot be neglected at any cost. By implementing firm rules and regulations, the concerns associated with cultural loss and environmental damage can be solved in the future.'",

Others however, say that cooperation and teamwork and skills are more important discuss both sides and give your opinion' \n 'Text': 'Whilst individuals contend the notion that the primary objective of schools should be teaching kids how to be competitive with each other, others share an opposing view by claiming that soft skills bear an unparalleled importance to establishing an environment which is run by collaboration. It is my contention that for children to be successful in their future life endeavours, both of these skills are equally important and should be amended into  classroom education. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I think every person was intrinsically born with a competitive drive inside them waiting to be harnessed by its host. Therefore, the role competitiveness plays in a child's life should be acknowledged by education providers so that classrooms can be arranged in a form that healthy rivalry is fostered. This is particularly a prudent commitment for  future generations to always push each other's limits to be better. For example,  constructive competition in a classroom can be utterly beneficial for the continuous development of juveniles. Consequently, all this boils down to the teachers who are primarily responsible for setting up and maintaining this system without undermining the quality of education.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the contemporary world, soft skills like teamwork and collaboration are extremely vital for adolescents in order to be  admirable leaders. With the help of these properties, children can learn how to be part of any society both in their professional and personal lives. Furthermore, excess competition is notorious for making people toxic and uncooperative, thus, resulting in failures. To exemplify this statement, schools should be organized in a way that every student participates in different science and sports competitions to hone their soft skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that competition and collaboration can be contrary to power holders in certain cases, schools should have a classroom environment where juveniles are able to practice  healthy competition while helping one another to overcome difficulties.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'Many means of transportation are responsible for ecological impact all over the world. Although individuals as well could contribute to reducing the damage to the environment, I do believe that politicians could make laws for those big polluters, as it could be more impactful. \r\n\r\nThese days, governments try to educate people on global warming, greenhouse gas and pollution in general, to reduce our impact on the environment. This issue is a major concern for everybody on earth and we are all trying to be part of the solution. For example, in Europe, many countries are encouraging people to buy electric cars which pollute less the atmosphere, Or are telling them to lower the heat of their homes.  \r\n\r\nCruise ships, factories, planes and transport companies, however, are responsible for a large part of the annual pollution rate. Studies have shown that tour cruise ships emit more greenhouse gases than several thousands of cars. Therefore, I feel that politicians should make laws to manage the amount of these means of transportation, in order to reduce drastically the world's environmental damage. For instance, we could make quotas of planes able to fly each day, which could reduce CO2. Nevertheless, I understand that from an economic view, politicians are careful to make decisions in favour of the climate, as it could damage the world's economic balance. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, everybody should care about the environment and pollution. Many people are trying individually to act for the planet, which is important. However, I agree that decisions could be taken by politicians, to highly reduce the impact of major polluting companies.'",

Some people think that specific animal extinction is severe, while others argue that focusing on other environmental challenges is crucial. I am in favour of the latter, and in this essay, I will discuss both sides and offer my opinion with examples in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental problems are associated with multiple dimensions, including environment, climates, animals, plants, humans and so on. First and foremost, climate change is the top urgent list of our world, this is always accompanied by rising oceans, strong storms, increasing drought, etc, leading to disasters. Take Australian bushfires as an example, climate change, can trigger extremely high temperatures and low rates of rainfall, which make forest fires take place more frequently, and threaten not only human living but also koala habitats and food. In addition, in terms of pollution, ocean pollution has incremental growth, putting a lot of creatures at risk. That is to say, to address the particular endangered animals issue, people should put more effort into other environmental crises, despite animal preservation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as more and more unique flora and fauna have become fewer or endangered, taking action to tackle it immediately is necessary or more of them will be extinct. Furthermore, extinction may have a ripple effect not only causing the other species to disappear but further accelerating biodiversity loss.

I totally disagree with the suggested statement since opening new spaces to exploitation would cause environmental harm and  generate conflicts between powerful countries. \r\n\r\nThe exploitation of spaces that might contain oil and gas will lead to the destruction of the environment. Furthermore, extracting these forms of energy to supply consumer societies causes important harm to the biosphere of untouched spaces.

Moreover, these states tend to start conflicts in order to claim the locations of their desires.

Using this, they can improve their vocabulary, skimming, and scanning skills. For instance, they read many articles or electronic newspapers on the website every morning, so their reading skill will be improved. In terms of writing skills, they can also read some examples of essays from reliable sources on the internet. Furthermore, using computers for writing applications will reduce using paper, which many people should adapt to paperless.\r\n\r\nCommunicating using mobiles and computers has other positive effects, especially for pupils and tutors at university. They can communicate by using email to talk about their assignments and projects. Moreover, using video conference apps to learn about these skills will give them more comprehensive knowledge and another perspective. They can share tips and tricks on improving skills and apply them by regularly doing online exercises on computers and phones. Therefore, these skills will be upgraded, and they can achieve their best. In addition, they can adapt these skills to do their research and dissertation, resulting in good final grades to graduate.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, technology machines play essential roles in the lives of youngsters.

Many individuals assert that this idolization brings these well-known people some responsibilities. In my opinion, sports people should feel responsible for their fans. Moreover, they must be careful about their actions as they may affect their fans in a positive or negative manner. \r\n\r\nFirstly, a lot of children have a tendency to be famous and successful sports players in their teenage. Accordingly, they try to copy the most well-known and top champions in their desired fields. For instance, a pupil, who is enthusiastic to be a booming football player, finds Christiano Ronaldo or Leonel Messi as his role models and tries to resemble their professional and personal lives. Thereupon, this idolization would mislead these infants if these famous people had corruption.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these famous people must beware and be cautious as their fans, mostly teenagers and the youth, could be affected by their deeds both negatively and positively.  Lots of pupils who imagine a future like that of their idolized person would experience disillusionment if their favourite sports players committed something wrong even after the end of their professional lives. For example, Diego Maradona, an Argentinian football legend, has always been worshipped due to his memorable achievements in football. Nevertheless, he was remarkably criticized because of his addiction to Cocaine. This also brought his fans a substantial amount of disappointment as he has always been an idol both nationally and internationally. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many youths and teenagers idolize sports people as they are interested in making the same life as theirs, and these idolized people are also responsible at all times as they are imitated by those young generations.'",

The question of whether they ought to be obligated as role models has prompted considerable debate. While many contend against this, others advocate for it, and this I firmly agree with, because most teens value their opinion on matters, as well as pick up on their way of life. Analyzing these facts would give an extensive understanding of this subject matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the celebrity's perspective matters to the young folks, as they take to heart any idea this group of people offers. For example, I would have been a school dropout if not that I overheard Tiger Woods encourage a mass education campaign in Africa, moreover, he even offered to give scholarships to about 100 students. Clearly, this is a task only superstars are capable of achieving. Therefore, it makes it clear that they ought to be character figures to children.\r\n\r\nSecondly, teenagers tend to pick up some of the idolized celebrity characters, since they see them as demigods. For instance, my elder brother became a chain smoker, and due to that, he saw Jay Okocha smoke on television, and he never stopped since then. Obviously, this is the influence that sports stars have on kids. Thus, it becomes apparent that they should have an obligation to be role models to young people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, professional sports stars have always been our children\u2019s idols. The argument surrounding whether they should be obligated to be their role model has sparked a substantial dispute.

Examining this factuality has proved that sports folks should have the responsibility to act as role models.'",

People all over the world wear the same fashions, watch the same t.v. channels, use the same brands and have similar eating habits. Do you think that the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'In the contemporary era of globalization, remarkable shifts are occurring across various facets of life, including fashion, entertainment, cuisine, and lifestyle habits. While some perceive these trends as fostering a sense of global unity and equality, others argue that they lead to the erosion of cultural diversity and local traditions. In my opinion, while globalization presents undeniable advantages in fostering interconnectedness and reducing prejudice, its drawbacks cannot be overlooked.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the homogenization of global culture, characterized by the widespread adoption of similar fashion brands, television programming, and dietary preferences, has undoubtedly contributed to a sense of shared identity among people worldwide. This interconnectedness has the potential to diminish prejudices and foster greater tolerance among diverse populations. For instance, individuals who migrate for education or employment find solace in familiar foods and customs, reducing feelings of alienation and homesickness.\r\n\r\nConversely, the relentless march of globalization threatens to undermine the rich tapestry of cultural diversity that defines societies across the globe. Local industries and traditions are increasingly overshadowed by global conglomerates and standardized consumer preferences, leading to the marginalization and extinction of indigenous practices. For example, the proliferation of global fashion brands may lead to the decline of local artisanal crafts and traditional attire, impacting livelihoods and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while globalization brings about undeniable benefits such as enhanced connectivity and reduced discrimination, it also poses significant challenges to cultural diversity and local autonomy. To navigate this complex landscape effectively, it is essential to strike a balance between embracing global influences and preserving the unique identities and traditions that define us.

In my opinion, I completely agree with the statement because of the unlimited availability of academic sources and it enhances the cognitive ability of the students to think beyond the syllabus.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason why teaching should be done through computers and websites is, because of the attraction of these platforms students tend to get more engaged and can access vast amounts of knowledge through a single click.

Thus, involving them at the earliest age for digital learning would definitely make them dive into the academic curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe second main reason is that studying through these mediums not only improves their ability to search for unlimited sources but also improves their cognitive ability to face any challenges boldly. The reason behind this is, that by exploring the available sources, they are exposed to the new technological world where they can experience hands-on training which in turn increases their problem-solving skills. For Instance, Juniors who want to know about a specific topic don't really need to depend upon the teaching staff for their project or homework completion.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Some argue that pupils in further education have the freedom to only learn their major or learn about additional fields if they opt to do so. Others think it is more crucial to solely focus on qualifying. In this essay, I will discuss both views and suggest my own opinion. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, advocates of diverse education claim that it is highly beneficial to be exposed to numerous study sections as it assists in obtaining various job opportunities. To be specific, in recent years, companies tend to prefer employers with multiple skills. For example, employees would definitely give a chance of work experience to those who majored in more than two subjects rather than those who took a major in one subject, as they believe the former group will have more comprehensive educational sources and flexibility in the workforce. Hence, studying different subjects during university years is favourable. \r\n\r\nHowever, others believe that concentrating on their subjects is paramount for acquiring a qualification. Proponents of this thought claim that individuals who only study their department often find themselves excelling in their field as they can foster profound knowledge. As a result, good grades lead to better chances for a qualification and occupation. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while diversity in learning can widen people's perspectives, I believe that students should do their utmost to study for official achievement since more professions require a certificate of individual abilities. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are two perspectives on pupils' behaviour during their tertiary education. Although both views have merits, I contend that focusing on a practical outcome is essential.'",

That is supposed to pose a threat to small stores and local communities. From my perspective, I am entirely convinced because of some reasons mentioned in this essay. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, they often offer lower prices compared to stores since they import goods in bulk. That is the main reason why many people prefer to shop in supermarkets to local shops. Moreover, there is a wide range of products so consumers can buy groceries, household items and electronics without visiting too many local shops which only sell some particular items. In addition, they bring convenience and accessibility. The reason is that they are set up in large premises and often equipped with ample parking spaces. As a result, their customers do not have to worry about finding a room to park their vehicles, especially in off-peaked times. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the possibility to approach local people, they have large budgets for advertising and marketing so their products are usually promoted on different channels such as TV, radio and online platforms. Hence, they attract more potential customers than traditional stores. Lastly, supermarket managers frequently run programmes for promotions and discounts, thanking loyal customers to get much attention from potential and existing customers, especially housewives. These aim to encourage them to purchase more for each shopping time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the supermarket establishment generally has threatened the operation and existence of small shops and local communities in neighbourhoods.'",

I largely agree with those who prefer to work for themselves, but there are a number of arguments in favour of the opposite point of view. In this essay, I plan to explore both ideas and bring a few examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, owning a business is a privilege not available to everyone. To elaborate, a real businessman must have certain qualities, an analytical mind and management skills. For example, my father-in-law has described and due to them, he was able to launch his own shop chain in my country. Needless to say, owning a company gives the owner freedom of working hours and days, a sense of self-confidence and success, as well as the opportunity to have a fairly decent income. For example, the head of the company I currently work for has a well-known company in Canada and significant profits. Obviously, these facts make him a successful person.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being a full-time employee of a company means not worrying about financial plans and not thinking about the risks that accompany any business. Moreover, an employee has a stable salary, and, consequently, a stable living standard. If a person is satisfied with his income, he will be probably happy. If not, he has a chance to seek for more profitable job, which is easier than to reform a whole business.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although working in a company and earning a stable salary is more suitable for most people, still, having your own company provides more benefits to the owner, despite all the challenges and risks associated with it.'",

However, others hold the view that there are more effective alternatives to deal with lawbreakers. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Some people claim that every lawbreaker should be imprisoned, while others believe that there are better ways to handle criminals. This essay will discuss both views and contend in favour of the latter. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, those who advocate for imprisonment argue that the stricter the punishment becomes, the less the crime occurs. To be specific, when lawbreakers are locked away from society, they are deprived of re-offending. For example, a notable study conducted by Korea University in 2011 revealed that countries with strong punishments like imprisonment were likely to have low crime rates. In addition, the experts concluded that the threat of serving a prison sentence may deter others from breaking the law. Moreover, jails provide an opportunity for rehabilitation as inmates can be educated through various programs and thus, easily reintegrate into society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others contend that alternatives like community service, probation, fines, or counselling can be more favourable ways to deal with felons. For instance, by undertaking community service, offenders can repay their debt to society and contribute positively to the public. This not only benefits those directly involved but also sends a message to society that there are consequences for legal actions. Furthermore, imprisoning all criminals is highly ineffective, as it is a waste of money. It is true that it requires a lot of budget and widened space to manage the accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I believe the best approach lies somewhere between.  Although serving a prison sentence can be a strong deterrent to committing a crime, other measures are still required as they alleviate the overcrowding problem in jail. Hence, it is beneficial as it allows resources to be focused on more serious and dangerous criminals. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some individuals say that all culprits should be sent to prison, others believe that it is not always the best solution. However, I think that a mitigated approach is crucial as every solution is advantageous.'",

Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'Some people believe marketing is a crucial strategy for selling products, while others feel that commercials have become not so effective. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and explains why I believe advertising is still important to business.\r\n\r\nA few think it is important to advertise products for good sales results. The first reason is that nowadays, people often follow at least a couple of influencers on social media. As a result, their followers will be more likely to purchase the item they are recommending, since they trust their opinion. For instance, my sister is keen on buying new skincare creams just because she has seen a celebrity talking about them on Instagram. Another reason, it can trigger the fear of missing out. According to recent psychological studies on humans, we are often scared of being left out because this can possibly threaten our well-being, whether physically or socially.\r\n\r\nHowever, others feel that advertising is not as effective as it used to be. This might be due to too much unrelevant content in the media. This is because anyone can pay a fee to have their business advertised on the internet. As a consequence, one's product can be lost in the middle of social media's ads frenzy and not perform as expected. Moreover, there are usually too many competitor companies. Therefore, it has become more challenging to stand out to possible clients since they might be already interested in a similar item from a cheaper brand. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe both sides of the argument have merits. However, overall, I think that the advantages of being advertised by social media influencers and the fear of missing out phenomenon outweigh the downsides of the crowded advertising vehicles and having too many similar brands in the market. Furthermore, in my opinion, business competition problems can be minimized by having a high-quality innovative product and excellent customer service.'",

This essay discusses the merits and drawbacks of this phenomenon and explains why I believe that the advantages are greater.\r\n\r\nThere are two main benefits of taking a year's break from studies. The first of these is that people might have the opportunity to experience different careers. By doing so, they may discover a profession they want to pursue in the future. For instance, if I had known about an architect's daily routine, I would not have chosen architecture as my major. Furthermore, it will be possible to mature a bit before making an important step in life. This is due to having time to reflect on themselves and their personal relationships.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also drawbacks to this. The most significant is that it can be challenging to go back to studying after the momentum is gone. This is because some people might be already too engaged in work and in need of their salary. For example, I found it difficult to stop working from my full-time job to dedicate most of my time to college because I was financially unstable. In addition, another downside is family pressure. By not having attended university yet, it can be psychologically exhausting when familiars insist on asking repetitive questions related to future studies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe there are merits and drawbacks of a year break between secondary school and university. However, overall, I think the advantages of exploring different types of work and having time to personally grow outweigh the disadvantages of sometimes facing difficulties to stop working and possibly having issues with parents' demands. Moreover, I feel that family pressure could be minimized by both parties having a mature conversation about life expectations and plans for the future.'",

This assumption derives from the lack of later appropriate punishments while having been a detrimental issue resulting in the emergence of other negative traits in a child\u2019s behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the dishonesty of young people, lacking adequate education in behaving is the most fundamental reason. To explain this, a large number of adults who assume responsibility for a child\u2019s development, such as parents and teachers, find it cruel to punish their sons after making a mistake including behaving dishonestly. As a result, they ignore these punishments or treat them slightly which often leads them will continue their faults, in other words, being dishonest more frequently. For instance, it is found that numerous Vietnamese students are dishonest with their tutors about homework by copying from the Internet and handing it in, for this reason, this affects adversely their study performance over time.\r\n\r\nConsequently, provided young individuals keep being dishonest, other negative personality traits may occur. As a sequence, these consist of laziness and overdependence on other people. In particular, pupils were dishonest in completing or did not take their homework seriously because they were too lazy   , then became over-reliant on other efficient gadgets, social platforms or artificial intelligence, for example, to finish. Therefore, this has an extremely concerning impact on teenagers\u2019 holistic development later on.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the strong agreement of the Z generation is more dishonest than the older is due to the lack of justifiable punishments for their dishonesty-related faults.

Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'The shift towards offering qualifications through distance learning via the Internet has become increasingly prevalent in universities and colleges. This trend presents both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, both sides will be explored before evaluating whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, online learning proves to be a great alternative although traditional universities are still widely considered as the best way to acquire knowledge and a diploma. Firstly, distance learning makes education more accessible to a broader range of individuals, including those who may have geographical, financial, or time constraints that prevent them from attending traditional classroom-based programs. This accessibility can democratize education and provide opportunities for lifelong learning. Secondly, this learning method offers flexibility in terms of scheduling and pace of learning. Students can access course materials and participate in discussions at their convenience, allowing them to balance their studies with work, family obligations, or other commitments. On top of that, online courses can be more cost-effective for both students and educational institutions. It eliminates the need for commuting and reduces expenses associated with campus facilities and infrastructure. Additionally, online courses may require fewer resources to develop and deliver compared to traditional classroom-based programs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this way of learning remotely without being in regular face-to-face contact with teachers in the classroom is negative from two aspects. First, online students cannot develop comprehensively like the way other students who attend classes at school do. During online courses, students can barely make friends or even compete with their peers. This is often linked to the fact that those learners seem to undervalue the significance of interaction and rivalry with classmates in an educational environment which, actually, are great stimuli for scholastic success. Second, online learning relies heavily on technology, which can present technical challenges such as unreliable internet connectivity, compatibility issues with devices, and learning platform glitches. These challenges can disrupt the learning experience and create frustration for students and instructors alike.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while distance learning can be a valuable supplement to traditional classroom-based education, it should not entirely replace face-to-face instruction. A blended approach that combines the benefits of both modalities, leveraging technology to enhance learning while preserving opportunities for interpersonal interaction and mentorship, may offer the most balanced and effective educational experience. Ultimately, the key lies in leveraging technology thoughtfully to complement and enrich the learning experience while addressing the inherent challenges of distance learning.'",

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'The question of what components contribute to one's success in life is a multifaceted one. Some emphasize the significance of diligence and persistence, whereas others attribute success to other factors like wealth and good looks. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, advocates of hard work and determination argue that success stems from personal development and self-improvement. By setting goals, working diligently, and persevering through challenges, individuals can achieve their desired outcomes. They believe that these qualities cultivate resilience, enabling individuals to bounce back from setbacks and failures. This is because they learn from their experiences, adapt to changing circumstances, and continue to strive for success despite obstacles. Furthermore, the journey of being hard-working and diligent fosters valuable character traits such as discipline, resilience, perseverance, and grit. These qualities are essential for long-term success and fulfilment in various aspects of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some believe that success is heavily influenced by factors such as wealth and appearance, as they provide access to resources, networks, and opportunities that can accelerate one's path to success. That is why individuals born into affluent families or possessing certain physical attributes may have inherent advantages in society. Moreover, money and appearance are often associated with societal status and prestige. To be more specific, people may judge success based on external markers such as material wealth, physical attractiveness, and social standing, rather than intrinsic qualities or achievements. For example, celebrities such as actresses and pop stars stand out due to the fact that they have appealing appearances, giving them opportunities to gain funding from companies and  build a reputation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although factors such as money and appearance may offer advantages in certain contexts, I firmly believe that success in life primarily comes from hard work and determination. While external elements may influence opportunities and perceptions, they do not guarantee sustained success or fulfilment. True success is rooted in the journey of self-discovery, continuous learning, and the relentless pursuit of one's passions and goals.'",

Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?' \n 'Text': 'It is believed to be essential for people to venture outside the boundaries at the workplace as well as in their daily lives. This essay will argue that despite the fact that maintaining the status quo could save people from certain dangers, it is far more advantageous for human beings to go out and take risks because it is a necessary step to any success. \r\n\r\nNegatively, venturing into the unknown may expose individuals to unwanted threats. Things like extreme sports such as jumping and cave diving or hiking in the wilderness of Antarctica which need meticulous planning and preparation are not the games for ordinary people. For instance, every year there are serious injuries and fatalities reported when inexperienced mountain climbers try to make their way to the summit of Everest. However, while such incidents may hinder human bravery at first, I believe that daring actions are essential to achieve greater success.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA major benefit of taking risks is that it allows human beings to step out of the playground of mediocrity and push the boundaries of possibilities. This is to say that risk-takers usually view challenges as learning opportunities rather than a peril to stay away from and despite initial fear and uncertainties, it is quite rewarding to see their dedication bear fruit at the end. In fact, no historical figure has ever made a difference by playing it safe and being mediocre but they chose to take calculated risks. Take the founder of Ford as an example, he would have never invented the automobile if he had listened to the naysayers and refused to improve the engine from time to time until it became the renowned Ford cars we see today. Therefore, I am of the opinion that without trying new things, no greatness is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although ventures in personal and professional life can be dangerous to some extent, people should consider taking risks as a requisite for success. For all the reasons above, the benefits of having an adventurous mind outweigh its drawbacks.'",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'It is argued that the proliferation of global corporations and internationalization offers benefits to all people. I agree with the aforementioned statement because of reasons relating to a higher level of employment and enhanced cross-cultural communication skills.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this trend brings more job opportunities for local residents. Since international firms, which open their branches in different countries, require a high level of workforce, they will need to recruit more local employees to operate the business. As a result, the natives are offered a decent occupation with lucrative incomes to cover their living expenses and in some cases, spend more generously on their shopping. For example, Samsung, a renowned Korean technology corporation, has created a large number of jobs for Vietnamese since 2018, through cooperating with the local government to successfully tackle the high unemployment rate in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nSecondly, people have a chance to develop multicultural communication skills as globalization is promoted. On a personal level, it is now easy for workers to learn about foreign cultures and customs, enabling them to acquire more knowledge and insight into varying international practices. As they are exposed to cross-cultural diversity in their working environment and society, they  become more able to show  empathy and tolerate cultural differences. At the company level, globalization leads to a more diverse range of potential business partners and diversifies their investment portfolios, which contributes to their profit generation. Consequently, having global partnerships is essential for businesses to compete in the growing international market.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that globalization itself is a threat to local businesses. With the impact of globalization, more and more new products are becoming available in the market and people have choices. In other words, there is greater competition in the market. Thus, local trades, particularly small and medium businesses might not survive in the long run and this has negative consequences on the local economy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although I acknowledge the positive impacts of multinational companies and globalization, such as more jobs in local areas and better cross-cultural communication, the negative consequences on local business cannot be ignored. This requires implementing policies and regulations that promote sustainable development and support domestic enterprises while harnessing the opportunities presented by globalization.'",

For this reason, some citizens try to copy famous personalities seen on different social net as a way to increase viewership. More views mean more money. For instance, many people these days imitate the personalities of influential stars and post such videos and pictures on different online platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. If  this kind of  content is viewed by many, the owner is paid decent money.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, seeing that most countries have unstable economies and numerous youngsters  are unemployed. Copying famous one's characters is not a bad tendency as it helps citizens who are not employed to get a living. For instance, a study in Zimbabwe by Runga found that more than 45 per cent of youths who have no jobs depend on creating content online. Some of the youngsters interviewed said this helped them to stay away from drugs as it kept them busy. They also mentioned that the money they got motivated them to do more scripts. Thus, copying  someone is a good move as it helps in putting food on the table. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, certain individuals copy their idols seen on different social networks as a way of making funds for a living since most of them are not working. This is not a bad move because they make clean cash. These and other issues are discussed above at length.'",

While some argue that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh its merits, I firmly believe that it is a positive development as it signifies positive personal growth and economic development.\r\n\r\nLiving alone or with a small family allows individuals to experience greater freedom and personal space. It becomes more convenient for them to engage in their passions and hobbies outside of work without being accountable to extended family members. In a nuclear family, which is small by nature, responsibilities are divided and assigned, enabling family members to dedicate more time to pursuing their interests. Furthermore, when living independently, individuals do not have to concern themselves with the opinions or responsibilities of other family members. This provides them with additional time for reflection and self-improvement, which is crucial for personal growth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, economic stability plays a significant role in the decision to live in a small family or independently. It is notably easier to manage financial responsibilities when living alone or with a partner and only one child. This allows for better financial planning, as it can provide a higher quality of life for their children and savings for emergencies. Additionally, living independently encourages individuals to develop essential life skills such as personal financial management, household chores, cooking, and shopping. Independent living also means not having to provide for other family members continually, which helps avoid excessive expenses.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am confident that the trend toward smaller households and independent living is beneficial for society as a whole. It offers increased personal space and freedom, along with financial advantages and valuable life skills.'",

Some people say that countries and individuals should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on the problems of human beings. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.' \n 'Text': 'It is true that these days, many wild animals are on the verge of extinction. Thus, many people argue that authorities and individuals should contribute to the conservation of these species. Meanwhile, there is also a widespread belief that priority should be given to human welfare. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the idea that countries and individuals should protect these animals from dying out is grounded in certain valid points. Firstly, endangered animals are often keystone species within ecosystems, playing critical roles in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Their extinction can lead to cascading effects throughout the ecosystem, ultimately impacting human well-being through disrupted ecosystem services. Secondly, many believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect  wildlife from extinction, especially due to the fact that human activity is a primary cause of the decline of many species. Animals have intrinsic value and a right to exist independent of their usefulness to humans. Additionally, preserving biodiversity ensures that future generations can appreciate the beauty and diversity of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that resources should be directed towards addressing pressing human needs, including poverty, hunger, and healthcare, rather than conservation efforts. In many parts of the world, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the human population faces severe challenges like poverty, famine, epidemics, and natural disasters, with citizens struggling to secure basic necessities amidst prolonged droughts and food shortages. If a government allocates a significant portion of its budget to animal conservation efforts at the expense of addressing pressing human needs, local communities may face devastating consequences, intensifying difficulties in making a living and sparking ethical debates about prioritizing wildlife over the immediate well-being of its people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is essential to address human needs and alleviate suffering, I believe that protecting endangered animals is not mutually exclusive to addressing human-centric issues. Both can and should be pursued simultaneously, as they are interconnected. Preserving biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the health and resilience of ecosystems, which ultimately support human well-being. Moreover, many conservation efforts can have positive economic impacts, contributing to sustainable development and poverty alleviation.'",

With the advent of computers, some people think that computer skills be made us a fourth skill to be added to the list. To what extent do you agree?' \n 'Text': 'The traditional material of education including reading, writing and maths is being speculated to shift by many, with a growing regard for computer science as a necessary concept, a new idea in training students. In this essay, I will advocate this idea and explain my reasons in favour of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, computers have become a ubiquitous device that affects several sections of our lives. Without having essential knowledge of computer skills, we probably have a lot of troubles in our daily routines. Computers have also become an integral part of most  jobs. Accountants, teachers, and bank clerks are only a few of many examples of this reality.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  digital technology is replacing the other types of communication methods. The emergence of computers  gives many an opportunity to talk and see each other at the same time, a precious capability that makes an enormous contribution to saving our time and resources. For example,  meetings can be easily held with the attendants from different places of the world with just a few clicks.\r\n\r\nLast but not least,  computers have had a deep effect on the other sciences. With aid of the computers, many calculations in maths, and engineering can be done in the blink of an eye. In this respect, progress in these sciences can be accelerated considerably. For instance, constructing a massive building or skyscraper has been possible just because  the software does heavy arithmetic calculations.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, learning computer skills is a must for most  people. Teaching basic instructions in schools will enable the students to be more prolific and successful in their future social lives and careers. Computers can facilitate the process of communication and reduce the waste of  time and  money. The extraordinary potential of computing has made these intelligent devices a good aid in  the process of research and development. All in all, it seems that unless one doesn't know how to work with a computer, they will be considered illustrated.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians, or sports stars are paid too much money.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nWhich other types of jobs should be highly paid?' \n 'Text': 'Some people think that the salaries of famous musicians, movie stars, and sports celebrities are too high. This essay discusses why I agree with the statement and which other careers should be paid more.\r\n\r\nI strongly agree that celebrities' salaries are too high. This is because their earnings are disproportionally higher than those of non-known artists. For instance, I am at the beginning of my artistic career and, very often, I find myself struggling to pay rent and other essential bills. Another reason why I think this statement is true is that most well-known entertainer often spends a lot of cash on luxury products. The reason for this might be that they are constantly trying to prove their social status by purchasing futile items, such as jewellery, cars, or mansions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other careers should earn more. The first of these are health-related positions, such as doctors, nurses, and dentists. This is because people's lives depend on this type of work and therefore, they should be paid accordingly. Another profession that should have a higher wage is educators, such as schoolteachers. The reason for this is that education is one of the most important pillars of a developed society. Consequently, educational workers' pay should be higher due to their responsibility to the country's teaching system.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my reasons to believe that celebrities are paid too much are that they receive a disproportional amount of cash in comparison to beginner artists and that they are often keen on spending their salaries on luxury items. The professions that should be paid a lot more than they usually do are health-related positions and educators.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasise that their products are new in some way. \r\n\r\nWhy is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'These days various companies are producing new advertisements regarding their brand-new goods that are not frequently seen compared to the past. To me, this is because, in today's world, new products are more eye-catching to notions than what they have previously seen, so they tend to buy them. Therefore, I believe that it is a negative development, due to a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, advertisements are going in a direction that depicts a brand that has produced an interesting new product that has not been seen before. This is because, individuals are becoming more interested in things that are somehow unique, which brings curiosity for them to try them. In this case, businesses are putting more effort into coming up with new ideas, to improve their trade and earn more money. For example, makeup brands are now producing brand-new makeup every day to get people's attention to try them out, and also this can not be done without proper advertising. Furthermore, they will spend a great amount of their money on advertisements to bring up the notions of curiosity.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, this statement holds various drawbacks, due to the fact that much more primary materials will be used for fulfilling society's needs. This situation will destroy the environment by providing raw materials that can be extremely harmful to nature, as this process requires extra effort and a great amount of energy will be wasted. On the other hand, this might cause wasting money on unnecessary products while the old ones work properly. This method, moreover, is a way to brainwash people into spending their bucks for company growth. On the contrary, the result of purchasing these products is consumerism which has significant disadvantages, as individuals might not be satisfied with their belongings and always try to reach for more.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I hold the belief that advertising to get society's attention to purchase a new product might be beneficial for the companies as it will bring undeniable damage to the economy and our minds, to pursue more than what is needed.'",

I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThis essay will look at the benefits and drawbacks of this situation.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, the higher amount of adolescents can be an issue for the government, specifically in the case of the ability to pay. Moreover, young people apply for medical treatment much less often than elder people, which can negatively affect the turnover of the hospitals  and considerably decrease medical progress in the countries. To give an illustration, according to the statistics of the Eurasian National University, there is a piece of evidence that in most cases 50+ years old adults start to have medical check-ups and use other medical services.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the main advantages of a large number of youngsters can influence the economy's prosperity and a stronger workforce. Besides, young individuals have more abilities to work and bring benefits to the economy of the country.For instance, the average age of the population in Kazakhstan is around 30 years, which positively impacts the social development of the country. What is more, it is undeniable that each country takes into account the possibility of potential wars and organizes the appropriate preparation, therefore  young citizens are in demand of those kinds of situations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can hardly be denied that there are negative sides to increasing  the young population but nevertheless, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for several reasons mentioned in the reason.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'In many countries, traditional customs are being lost.\r\n\r\nWhy would this happen?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think school and parent should do to keep these custom alive?' \n 'Text': 'In contemporary times, many nations are undergoing the elimination of their own cultures. This essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind this phenomenon before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle it.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary reasons why local customs are disappearing in numerous territories. First and foremost, the development of international tourism could badly affect local communities. To be more specific, an increase in the number of tourists means higher demands for touring services such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation. As a result, individuals who work in craft villages are likely to switch their careers to pursue jobs involved in travelling fields, thereby leading to the extinction of traditional occupations and other unique handmade products. Furthermore, the evolution of the Internet and the digital era could harm regional citizens. This is because Western culture is becoming prevalent in social media, which could have an influence that encourages locals to change their lifestyles, such as clothes, the colour of their hair, or hobbies, as they try to imitate foreigners.\r\n\r\nTo protect the traditional customs against negative effects from alien cultures, the following essential steps should be taken. One remedy is that government bodies could pass some laws to maintain domestic occupations. For example, authorities could establish funding to improve craftsmen's salaries as well as introduce their special goods to the world, which could not only help the locals have better lives but also create a sustainable tourism industry. Another remedy is that the government could increase citizens' awareness about their values and histories. By providing more cultural lessons in schools or publishing magazines and news about historical sites or scenic spots as actions of conservation, thereby enhancing the country's imagination in the public eye as well as enriching individuals' patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative tendency, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to deal with this issue.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Some people believe that everyone has the right to have access to university education and that governments should make it free for all students no matter what financial background they have.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree ?' \n 'Text': 'People have different views as to whether university education should be free for everyone regardless of financial status. Despite the fact that there are drawbacks to providing free university education, I believe that it brings about much more benefits. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are three main reasons  why governments should not offer free university education to citizens. Firstly, the budget could be used on other more important things such as healthcare and infrastructure to ensure a higher standard of living for citizens. Secondly, the rich can easily afford to pay for their college education, so it would be unnecessary for governments to support them. Finally, not all governments can afford to cover university education costs because there would be too much financial burden to bear. This is especially true in times of financial crisis like the subprime crisis in 2008 when budgets were cut severely.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are benefits to making university education accessible for all citizens. Free and quality higher education should be the basic right of every citizen since they pay taxes in one of the other ways to the government. This will also promote equality and reduce inequality among the rich and the poor where there is a widening income gap. By ensuring equal opportunities and an adequate living standard for all people, the crime rate will be much lower. Moreover, free university education would provide students with a fresh start since many young people in the US have a huge student loan debt.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of offering free university education for all citizens far outweigh the disadvantages.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'Plastic shopping bags are used widely and cause many environmental problems. Some people say they should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?' \n 'Text': 'The question of whether the use of rubber bags, which are widely used across the globe for shopping, ought to be restricted, since it is not eco-friendly has sparked a substantial debate. While many advocate for this, which I firmly agree with, others argue against it. Analyzing these facts that it is non-biodegradable, as well as dangerous to aquatic life, would give a comprehensive overview of this subject matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, polyethene bags can neither decompose nor can they be recycled after use, so they are often trashed. For instance, the research report, from my recently completed capstone project on environmental analysis, shows that these bags are left to litter the streets since the dump sites are filled up and there is no other alternative means of disposal. Obviously, this can only be controlled if the production is stopped. Therefore, banning the use of plastic bags, in shopping centres is the only means of stopping this.\r\n\r\nSecondly, most marine life dies as a result of digesting these bags, which are often dumped into the oceans. For example, the frozen catfish I purchased a few days ago, has nylon twisted in the stomach which killed it. Clearly, most aquatic life would be saved if the use of polythene bags were banned completely. Thus, one of the reasons why Poly plastic bags should be banned.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the argument surrounding whether plastic bags used for shopping  should be banned  because they cause damage to the environment has prompted considerable dispute. Some champion this idea, which I completely support, whereas others contend against it. Examining the factuality that it is non-recyclable and dangerous to  marine species, has proved the need for total eradication of these bags by the authorities.'",

This essay discusses the reasons why this might be happening and the drawbacks of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThere are two main benefits of society working on their own. The first of these is that workers usually have more creative freedom regarding their work. This is because being the owner of a company makes every decision to rely on them. For instance, I am self-employed and I get to choose the quality and aesthetics of how my services are presented and delivered to my clients. Furthermore, it's more profitable. The reason for this is that all gains are going to be theirs first. Therefore, they usually can earn more money per hour this way.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also downsides to this. The most significant is that the pressure of making the right decision is higher. This is because making the wrong call can be fatal to the business. For example, if I fail to deliver the product my client is expecting, I might lose their trust and they may not come back to give me a second try. Another drawback is that the workload can be more unstable. This can be due to the business not being known by many clients. Moreover, profit instability and higher levels of stress can lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the motivations behind many people choosing to be self-employed recently might be due to the creative freedom and profit benefits. The disadvantages are that it often leads to higher mental pressure and workload fluctuation.'",

        "input": "'Question': 'It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going to university what are the advantages and disadvantages of this?' \n 'Text': 'Nowadays, taking a year off prior to going to university is becoming an increasing trend amongst highschool seniors. This essay will present the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this trend. \r\n\r\nA sabbatical year allows future students to clear their head off before starting studying for their future career. Indeed, theses individuals use this twelve-month period to ask themselves existential questions necessary to ensure if they are heading towards the correct choice: Does the college meet their expectancies and desires? Do they have other options that they need to explore? These key questions allow them to be motivated in pursuing their bachelors. For instance, I took a break before going to a university of worldwide recognition: London School of Economics. During this time, I was able to fix my objectives for this course in addition to discovering London. This period ensured me I was making the right choice. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, years off can be quite dangerous because people tend to forget what they have learnt in highschool. Individuals become lazy and miss their work ethic and knowledge, making it hard for them to go back on the right track. For example, in a Cambridge Analitica study in 2023, the statistics illustrated that 70% of the students that have taken a gap time tend to drop out of university due to a lack of discipline which was lost during their educational break. 25% of the said potential bachelors declare having lost all their motivation due to it. \r\n\r\nAlthough gap periods can be devastating on the student\u2019s intellect and motivation, I think that the advantage outweighs the disadvantage. Hence, taking a year off is beneficial for individuals that might be unsure of their choices.'",

Is this a positive or negative development?' \n 'Text': 'In today\u2019s world, there is an increasing number of people seeking to learn about their lineage. Personally, this trend is caused by a wide range of contributing factors, however, its potential risks should not be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, this action could originate from several motives. It is the uncovering of the family\u2019s past that might make people proud of their origins. The reason is that when investigating who their ancestors were, they may find out that their predecessors played significant roles in society. For example, it is interesting that their relatives were talented generals or parts of royal families, thereby serving as motivation for individuals to strive for their success. Another aspect worth mentioning is that family cultural understanding would be fostered. Traditional values of their family such as respect, and loyalty,...as a result, could be passed down from generation to generation. In contrast, were youngsters not attracted to learning about their roots, those good values would run the risk of being harmed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, regardless of its merits, there are persuasive arguments as to why people might disapprove of exploring their family tree. So difficult is the research that it might be a time-consuming activity. This could come down to the fact that accessible or organized historical records are lacking due to so many factors namely war, natural disasters, and living location changes that data collection must be implemented in different places and might be impossible in some cases. The second drawback is that it could be to blame for potential emotional challenges including regret, suspicion, and misery. This is because unexpected or sensitive information through family history might be detected, which is one of the most significant reasons why a number of descendants feel disappointed after the investigation process. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, learning about family history is associated with some undesired results. It is highly recommended that this kind of passion should be taken at a moderate level.'",

Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?' \n 'Text': 'There is a worrying trend that after undergoing the initial punishment, many convicts are involved in further criminal activities. Personally, there is a wide range of contributing culprits behind this puzzling issue, however, it is not necessarily beyond solution.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the taxing problem of re-offence could stem from several factors. The first one is financial hardship. The reason is that they lack some essential skills and have an insufficient level of education to be able to walk into a job that enables them to sustain daily life. They, therefore, are likely to be lured to engage in activities without regard to legal constraints. Another aspect that is worth mentioning is the refusal of companies to rehabilitate prisoners regardless of their ability. This could come down to the fact that employers tend to consider offenders would put safety, security, and morality at risk, and along with it comes discrimination against them.\r\n\r\nA number of practical actions could be taken to overcome this hurdle. It is highly advisable for prisons to organize comprehensive job training programs. For example, courses such as making handicrafts, wood furniture, labour tools, and sewing clothes could be arranged regularly where lawbreakers can be instructed by vocational trainers, thereby facilitating a successful reintegration into society for wrongdoers afterwards. Furthermore, what the government should do is reduce taxes on companies that employ people who have been in prison. By doing so, they could help individuals establish a sense of belonging and community. Not until the authorities enforce that policy will the likelihood of reoffending decrease.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, reasons for recidivism vary and it is high time these aforementioned measures should be adopted to redeem the situation.'",

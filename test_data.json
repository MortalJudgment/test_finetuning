This essay will discuss the debate and give a concluding view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, those who support the idea of smoking in public simply wants to have freedom to do what they want. Consumer could insist that tobacco is their enjoyable habit, and every human being should have their own human rights to do what it gives them pleasure especially in workplaces, which makes them to have better output. For these people tobacco is the case.  For example, the severe kingdom in Iran had given the permission to their nation to have freedom of smoking. Furthermore, proponents could cite that tobacco gives them the opportunity to concentrate better. This kind of drug develop such calmness and relaxation that taker could be in an adequate situationship to think and work better in offices, which makes them to have a better output. Overall, this lawmaking amends the process of work for those who smoke. As an example, workers who can have their little competent thing, could regularly present in a satisfactory way.\r\n\r\nHowever, opponent of smoking tobacco in specific place could claim that this action could endanger other\u2019s state of health.  When consumers of tobacco smoke in closed room of eating place or working places, it seems that other attendees suffer from the smoky air, which it can later cause lounge cancer. For example, 20% of damage is belong to the smokers and the other 80% to the people who breath the poisoned air. Moreover, critics of this idea could cite that this unpleasant routine could show the city less aesthetic. Beauty of town should be saved due to the policy of tourists. When a state does not have the attraction no longer, it can damage country\u2019s roll to the world. In this case opponents could say that smokers should be obliged to not do this troubled manner.

The action of add tax maybe can reduce some emission from those vehicles, but I have to say the effect will be limited.\r\n\r\n    For one thing,if  the tax policy was acted, it will lower the life quality of  working class people while the rich people won't feel much difference. The users of fuel powered vehicles a lot are usually whealthy people, especially those who drives cars like landrovers and fancy race cars, these cars bruns way more fuel per meils than ordinary cars.

Government held elections every 4 or 5 years in most of countries. It usually takes years to pass the law about the tax, and tax on every fuel powered car driver for 1 or 2 years, then they hold a relection, new government maybe the axe the tax, because the citizens elect them for that.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Nowadays, housing crisis have emerged as one of the most pressing challenges in urban areas around the world. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and increasing economic disparities have contributed to a shortage of affordable housing, skyrocketing rents, and homelessness. \r\n\r\nOne of the primary causes of the housing crisis in cities is the imbalance between supply and demand. Many cities are facing a significant mismatch between the supply of housing and the increasing demand due to factors such as limitied land avilability, strict zoning regulations, and slow construction processes. Additionally, income inequality is another factor contributing to the housing crisis. Rising income disparities exaberate the situation, making it increasingly difficult for low-income indivisuals and families to afford suitable housing options. \r\n\r\nAddressing the housing crisis requires comprehensive and innovative solutions. I will suggest some strategies for tackling them. First, cities can implement affordable housing programs that provide subsidies, incentives, or partnerships with developers to increase the avilability of affordable housing units. This can be achieved through government fundings, tax breaks, or regulations that mandate a certain percentage of affordable units in new developments. \r\n\r\nAside from that, cities can review and update their zoining regulations to allow for higher-density development, mixed-used neighborhoods, and inclusiory zoining. Inclusionary zoining mandates a certain percentage of affordable housing in new developments, ensuring that socioeconomic diversity is maintained as neighborhoods evolve.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, people have to pay attention to the change of economic policies of a country and government should make a effort for solving problems consistantly. these methods can alleviate problems of a housing shortage and can make the society more inclusive, equitable and thriving. <END_E> ",

Science offers challenging field to solve like complex formula in math as well as physic. Owing to this condition, they choose others subjects that offer less challenges and easy way to handle. Although it also has its benefits for future, students still prefer to avoid science. For examples, arts subjects (music, writing, drawing, ect) and social subjects provide convenient for them. It is clear that recent times students avoid science due to its complexity and choose others subjects to feel relax living their school life.\r\n\r\nEventually, in the future, nations might become have less reasearches and have fewer remarkable discoveries because it will be difficult to fill science fields and it will less of jobseekers.

In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will elaborate on this in more detail.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, back in the days men were breadwinners and females were housewives in an ordianry family. Hence, females used to solely rely on their husbands for financial support. In other words marriage was essential for women to survive. However, with the change of time more females choose to pursue higher education and choose a career path. This provided financial freedom and an independent lifestyle. Therefore, marriage has become an option.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to the independent life style society started valuing equality among men and women. Many became feminists. And started to believe that a women's main job is not upbring children and taking care of a family. Thus, emotional freedom and well being also became an important aspects of life. For instance, ladies started following their dreams like travelling around the world, exploring new adventures and living a free life without any family responsibility.

What are the causes and solutions? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Nowadays more people tend to behave antisocially and there is a decline in respect for other people. There could be several reasons for that.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of the current increase in anti-social behaviour might be rooted in the ubiquious technological development, which has resulted in the decline in personal communication and the rise of human-machine interaction. Thus, we tend to interact more with the software than with human beings resulting in more antisocial actions. This problem might be solved by promoting the idea of interpersonal activities, communities and interest based clubs, which could encourage kinder and more amicable behavour. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for the lack of respect in everyday situations could be possibly that of the shortage of attention paid to the development of soft skills and emotional intelligence at schools. So, when graduates enter the fast paced productivity-oriented work environment they find themselves lacking empathy and ethical behavior, which not only hinders communication, but also results in smaller productivity. This can be solved early by implementing emotional intelligence classes in compulsory education at schools.\r\n\r\nFinally, the lack of mutual respect can also be rooted in the modern trend for assertiveness and brutality, which are oftentimes overestimated and promoted on social media. The cases of anti-social behavior have often been mistakenly shown as 'cool', which has led to more young people devaluating basic human virtues. The only possible solution to this can be in more spotlight hogged by the idea that kindness and respect are foundations for the successful life and traits of a strong personality.\r\n\r\nOverall, the issue of anti-social behaviour and the lack of mutual respect is quite acute, however there are a few solutions that could tackle it. <END_E> ",

First and foremost, it could guarantee the stability of staffs' lives. For example, besides their basic salaries, experienced employees could receive additional bonuses as a tribute to their dedication, which could help them easily cover their daily costs, such as accommodation, food, and bills. Furthermore, taking part in only one firm could support workers have successful career paths. This is because without worrying about financial burden, members of the company could focus on studying a particular field more deeply, thereby leading them to become professional experts but also taking on higher positions in the firms.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that altering different organisations could have significant benefits. One rationale is that it could improve jobholders' wages. In fact, they are likely to be paid higher than their current payments when they change jobs, thus, this is an opportunity to raise their incomes as well as the quality of their lives. Another justification is that new workplaces could provide a better developing environment.

Also, there are many digital applications which are difficult to understand on how to use it and some people think that the illiterates are not better equipped to use the technology. As a result, it has created a huge gap between the two sections of people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rise of social media has become a increasingly popular among all the sections of people.For example, facebook and instagram has brought people more closer together which eliminates the gap between rich and poor. Nowadays, almost all the people have access to the internet and they can learn about all the new digital products which are introduced around the world. This helps people from all sections have updated with all the latest new advanced technology.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, although there are many digital products which can not be afforded by some people, I strongly believe that the rise of technology has brought people more closer together and connected with each other. <END_E> ",

There can be many reasons of this and people may have varied opinions on the topic. However, my own perspective is uttered as under. The modern era brought a plethora of positive and negative changes that were needed. Although, the reasons for the said happening are not that simple. One of the reasons could be that after giving birth, the women are fed up of their schedule. So in order to have a change in their daily life, they opt for a job and as the baby is needed to be looked after, it is done by the male patent. The other reason may be the wave of feminism that is breaking the patriarchy and consolidating a novel matriarchy. Moving to the positive side, if the fathers are staying at home then the mother is relieved of the daily chores and it is also necessary for their proper recovery from the traumas that they might have experienced during the painful days. Apart from that, it is also beneficial on the global scale as development of a country is judged from the independence enjoyed by the females. Turning to the negative aspect, there might be some conflicts that may arise between the parents because the men are not as gentle as the women in dealing with the children. The prolonged harsh treatment to a child may result in improper growth of a kid. To recapitulate, It could be said that there are many merits of women being at work and fathers staying at home for looking after the children than the demerits. Hence, it could be taken as an appreciable development for the society. <END_E> ",

In my stance, the world lives in harmony is greatly positive and contributional to society. I will outline my viewpoint and reasons in the essay below.\r\n\r\nThe most significant basis why globalisation is a positive development for humanity is because it is profitable for the international and national economy. Through the means of technology and trades, products can be exported and consumed widely, creating an active economy climate through which nations can learn from each other. Owing to this trading network, countries across the world can cultivate their own economy by cooperating with other countries, indirectly improving the living condition of the people. For instances, Asian countries export their agricultural products to Western countries, therefore, the farmers can create more consumption market and also promote their own cultures to the foreign.\r\n\r\nAnother advantageous attribute of globalisation is in the social respect. When many individuals from different regions use the same social platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok, knowledge and experience can be disseminated globally and become known by others. Users can exchange their cultural differences and establish bonds with one another. In the big picture, this can promote the beauty of each cultures to international friends and further strengthen the relationships between nations, eradicating discrimination and inequalities.\r\n\r\nGranted, there are still some downsides of globalisation that cannot be neglected. One of them are environment pollution. As the economic race is becoming more compeititive between big international corporations, a negative trend arise to benefits their budget which is race-to-the-bottom. This trend exerts adversed effects on the evironment and is gradually destroying the ecosystem. However, the advantages eclipse these disadvantages on the whole, thereby, globalisation is still mainly beneficial to the progress of humanity.\r\n\r\nTo infer, globalisation does more good than bad. <END_E> ",

There is a wide range of reasons for this kind of phenomenon as well as a number of solutions to improve the situation. This essay will analyze and discuss such practices along with my own perspectives. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, people who are older than 50 years old typically approach the retirement, which also means that they are hardly able to sign long term contract. For example, the age of superannuation in Vietnam is 55 and 60 regarding to women and men respectively. Therefore, they will have only a few years left until the moment they resign so it will be a waste of time as well as resources in training for them. If they are more than that age, they will be unable to dedicate fully to the companies owning to the lack of flexibility of variable working environments. In addition, the older they become, the more responsibility they have to take on in term of family. Hence, this kind of applicants seems to be incapable of committing thoroughly themselves to the job. \r\n\r\nSecond of all, increasing in age level also leads to a plethora of health issues. While younger generation is supposed to be more active and self-motivated to engage in divergent assignments, the former ones depend a lot upon health situation. Seldom do they involve in the night shifts or work overtime. Moreover, they find it extremely challenging to learn innovative technology to keep up with the youth. As a result, participating in a team with other members will then shape them in the prejudice of underwhelmed productivity. This can lead to potential conflict among fellow colleagues in case they are unable to maintain professional integrity under stressful condition. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a plenty of solutions which can be taken into consideration to address this issue. It has to be based on not only the intervention of the government but also the self-effort of the people who are more than 50 years old. For instance, the authority can modify the current law of salary and bonus regime for experienced people, especially for experts. Furthermore, senior employees who consider themselves to be potentially laid-off ought to stay updated with the novel application of science and technology by taking part in workshops to further improve their value which help remain their current positions. Besides, they should both put more effort into enhancing physical health and balance their personal life versus their career so as to meet the demand of multitasks. I strongly have a thought that with obvious determination, great attempt along with perseverance will finally end up with desired success. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to comprehend the problem of old people seeking for good jobs, yet there are a number of solutions to solve it as well.

What are the causes. what solutions can you suggest. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'It is irrefutable that traffic jam has become a major problem in western socities. Some segments of society strongly argue that masses mostly stuck in the traffic on the roads and waste their precious time in metro cities.This essay intends to cast light on the contributing factors and remedial measures to put a halt to it.Further, I will explicate about this matter in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo embark with, a host of reasons can be attributed to this phenomenon. Colossal reason is the worse condition of the roads. To elaborate this, in this cutting-edge, the roads are not accurately maintained. Thus, folks do not drive properly but also bad incidents happens which leads to death. Moreover, inhabitats prefer to use private vehicles. To justify this, in the modern epoch, individuals commute through their own transportation instead of public way of transport. Ultimately, the traffic congestion has been significantly incline. To cite an example, a recent article in a prestigious newspaper highlighted that due to heavy traffic, 85% of workers did not reach at work on time because the citizens faced traffic problem on regular basis.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as every problem has their own curative measures. Foremost is that, funds should be allocated on maintance for the roads. To substantiate this, the national authorities should spend money on the streets for care or they should construct new bridges or roads for alleviate this issue. Besides this, the car pooling policy should be used by the public. Hence, this would be mitigate major obstacles such as traffic, air pollution etcetra. To exemplify, in 2019, a awareness campaign organized by renowned University in which youth provided awarness regarding car pooling policy which proved helpful.  \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, unquestionably, this problem has become a burning question of the day.Therefore, it is not an easy task to solve this. Regimen and society should come forward to diminish this complex issue. <END_E> ",

What other factors in a person's life affect happiness? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In  contemporary society, many people believe that having children makes people happiness and joy. However, others assert that there are diverse factors that bring to people happiness without kids. In this essay, I will explain why people who don't have their kids can feel happy and propose diverse ideas in people's lives affect happiness.\r\n\r\nThere are surely a few reasons why we can live it up without their sons and daughters. First and foremost, a main reason is that they can save a lot of money and they can expenditure their money on hobbies. For example, in Korea, they need a lot of money if they want to raise kids because of education fee, hospital charges, and clothes are expensive. In contrast, if they don't have kids they can learn whatever they want to learn such as sports, and arts, and even they can raise pets. Secondly, another reasonable one is that parents need not  argue about parenting problems for instance different ways of discipline,  education ways, and eating habits. Because, they are raised by different environments  they have diverse ideas when raising kids.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the above-mentioned content, there are various factors that make their lives happy. Firstly, raising pets such as dogs, cats, and parrots is one of the best ways to spend their time full of humour. For example, sometimes when I go to the park, I can see a dog and my grandmother and at that time, the owner says to me dog is better than the person because the dog obeys owner\u2019s requirements. Moreover, sometimes their residence makes people happy and comfortable. For example, in my case, whenever I return to my flat after my daily routine, I feel comfortable and thrilled.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, considering all the previously mentioned information even though having children has positive effects on theirs lives, however, I believe that we can fulfil our life happy with other ways. <END_E> ",

The acquisition of english language skills are more pivotal than that of local languages. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and explain why I consider both are equily significant,\r\n\r\nEnglish has been occupied the top spot of most spoken language, without certain extent of ability to speak english, it is in fact relatively difficult to reach higher level of achievement in my opinion. Meanwhile, lacking english skills can also results in reduction of opportunity, because almost every apsect in this society, being able to communicate in english is a huge bonus point, sometimes even being an unskippable requirement. Thus, if individuals do not have adequate skills of english, they will face challenges, such as rejections from universities and companies they have always aspired to get into.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is also crucial to learn local languages, as they contain the culture and history meaning behind it. Simultaneously, language is also one of th building blocks of its culture characteristic. If individuals tend to soley focus on studying english for a better opportunity to connect to other parts of the world, the discrepancy between every unique culture and language itself are possible to diminsih ultimately. Therefore, some measures should be executed. To provide an example, local languages courses are mandatory here in Taiwanese educational settings. In addition, from the beginning of one's school life, you have to study Madarin thoroughly, even the literature works and cultural value it contains. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion. I acknowlege how crucial it is to have the ability to commuciate in English in this globalizing era, preserving and recognizing the value that local languages possess are also essential. <END_E> ",

For example, we can use the apps to calculate our heart rate. Moreover, some apps would be useful when we face emergency situations by calling the police or hospital. \r\n\r\nHowever, working out our bodies is a crucial factor in maintaining our health. Sweating from our bodies can give us more energy and relieve our stress from the workplace. Since our body is not a machine, we should keep it moving and get adequate rest.

There are both merits and demerits, and I think the drawbacks are greater than the benefits. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several benefits of animal testing. First of all, animal testing is playing an increasingly important role in the field of medical industry. When researchers who majored in medical area find out new medicines of diseases, it has to be checked and tested. By using animals for testing, they can get various results such as side effects, validations and more, leading to the improvement of not only medical field but also human life. In addition, it is inevitable to use animals for testing instead of people. When scientists want to do test of their findings, it is hard for them to find individuals who want to participate in the experiment and it costs a lot. However, if they use animals, it is easy to find and spends much less. Therefore, there is no choice for them to use animal species for a test. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that the drawbacks outweighs the benefits, and there are some reasons of experimentation on animals. Firstly, the awareness of animal rights can be decreased. If people deem animals solely as a means of testing, animal\u2019s rights will be disappeared gradually. Human and animals must coexist together on earth, so people should preserve animal species, respecting their values. Moreover, experimentation on animals can exert a negative influence on human life. If researchers or scientists keep doing a test with animals, it will lead to the reduction of animal species. It is undeniable that animals play a crucial role in nature. Protecting animals is one of the effective solutions for preserving the natural environment, so it is imperative for individuals and society to stop animal testing. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that experimentation on animals is beneficial for the development of various fields. Nevertheless, people should protect and respect animals due to the responsibility, leading to the improvement of human life and the environment eventually. Therefore, governments or authorities worldwide should come into force a law associated with animal testing. <END_E> ",

As per my viewpoint it is the case in majority of subject choices due to societal pressures. However, this has to be changed in the future.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, interplay of society and family roles play a big role in the decison for careers. Women usually find that they have to play the role of a mother and educate their children and also they are required to pay more attention to the household chores. Hence, arts seems to be less challenging and it has less job prospects. The families preach this ideology that they have to take dual responsibilities so they try to minimize their career impact from the beginning. However, in the case of men, it is thought that they might make their career better in the engineering field by taking physics and they can excel in such subjects due to minimal pressure from parents to participate in household responsibilities. Thus, this might be the reason for such decisions to opt the professions.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it should be changed. The contenders argue that this has detrimental effect on the society as a whole. A female is a would be mother that is the first teacher of her offsprings. If she does  not has any knowledge about science then how will she impart this to her kids? For example, some studies suggest that upbringing is the most the important step in the development of intersts in certain subjects which will determine the subjects children takes in the future.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is widely witnessed that gender biases are practiced to decide careers among people.

Nowadays, with the help on telephones and internet, a person can talk to his friend or relative sitting in another country, however, it was not possible in 20th century. It not only helped to reduce the distance but also helped to make relationship stronger. Nevertheless, I agree that people are more busy on phones, whether in scrolling instagram, watching movies or other stuff like that, but the culprit behind this not phone, it's the individual who is using it.  He should reduce the time he usually spend on these gadgets, so that he can enjoy more with his family.\r\n\r\n    Moving further, another cause of less interaction is busy life.  There is big race going on in outside world and everyone wants to win it. Therefore, no one has leisure time for his love ones. For instance, students are working hard to achieve good grades so that the can get better job and earn more. Same is in the case of elder folks. They are running behind making more money and getting successful and because of all this, they are leaving behind their relationships.\r\n\r\n  To conclude, yes, at some extent mobile phones are the cause of less face to face communication but it also depends on the person how he use it.

Therefore, some people advocate that they do not have to lessen leisure activities in public in order to protect the crowd, yet others are no of strong belief about that matter. This essay strongly agrees with the opinion and considers that lessening activities is necessary to conserve people.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, plenty of issues in crowded places can be observed due to density of individuals. Which are namely infection, and disorders. In other words, administrations must restrict motion of humans in public in order to reduce viruses infecting over the air. For instance, proportion of illnes people was decreased by strict rules during the Corona-19 epidemic. Hence, carrying out limits in locals is significant so as to prevent public from diseases.\r\n\r\nNeverthless, in contemporary times, a myriad of countries  have struggled with terrorism issues. In addition, terrorists aim crowded places in order to properly implement their duties so a multitude of instructions, including prohibiting exhibitions or concerts, are being taken in order to guarantee population's life. For example, in 2017, a bomb attack in Turkey did not lead to huge issues since the governement had already applied ways preventing public. Thus, amending activities, such as concerts and festivals is fundamental to conserve crowd.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, restriction individuals' motions might firstly seem like a detrimental fact, yet it is extremely beneficial for public.

In my point of view, native languages should give preference in school by organizing the competition events and writting the slogans on walls.\r\n\r\nTo commence with first view, English is vital to teach in school because it is the main language of most developed nation. If students learn English in early ages, they can go abroad for study and face less difficulties in language barriers and they have more opperunities in different sectors. For example, a survey shows by CBC 75 percent people are English language speaker. Hence, learn english language makes easy to survive in developed countries.\r\n\r\nMoving towards my opinion, school needs to organize competition and writes the slogan on walls for survival of nation language. Firstly, schools need to create interest to speak native language and needs to organize competition on school level, state level and nation level and give some prize on winning.This will create the interest in students to learn more about local language. Moreover, schools and government need to write. The slogan on school walls in native language so students can read when they see and government need to put sign board in thier local language so it will not diminish. For instance, Kerala start putting the raid and village name sign in local language along with English. Therefore, competition enhance the interest in students and slogan helps to preserve the native languages. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, learning a English is not bag because it is worldwide language but school and government to take necessary step to preserve the native languages by creating the interest in students as well as writting on the walls. <END_E> ",

Therefore, most of them usually can try to guide their children in the right direction. Besides, friends are also very close ones for us. For this reason, they usually help to us that we make the right decisions. For example, any person wants to attempt to a new business.

Sometimes learning anything can be easy for one person, however another one can feel some difficulties. It does not mean that it is difficult in general.

In this essay, I will discuss the possible reasons that support each view and what benefits they bring to the society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the option to think that the pros of cheap airlines has its benefits for many convincing reasons. Most importantly, one positive of this development is the increased of travel in all walks of lives. For example, in the past traveling by air was mainly reserved for rich people, however, low-cost airlines offer more reasonable price for airing travel to go on vacation domestically or to foreign countries. Furthermore, it is also important to mention that it contributes more income for the tourism industry and globalization process. For instance, in Thailand where the government focuses a lot on the tourism industry, flights are considered to be cheaper as compared to other countries lead to more and more traveller come here and this is an attempt to attract tourists easily and boost the country's economy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of that, I contend that low-cost airlines are a negative growth. One of the drawback of cheap airlines expansion is the a release of carbon emission which released from using fossil fuels ( coal, gas, petro\u2026). Consequently, if there are numerous of people travel by planes because of the cheaper price, the gas emission will be pile up in the atmosphere and destroy the earth\u2019s ozone layer. Additionally, this is one of the most reasons responsible for greenhouse gas and global warming. Another key reason is the low-cost airplanes is the main reason that bring about economic slowdown in other types of transportation. Cheap airplane bring to user the most service in everything ( saving time, better service,\u2026.) while the others can\u2019t do that. For instance, low-cost airplanes can take you 10 times faster than a ship or a train do while the tickets get a similar price or it\u2019s service will be better than the others transportation many times. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a cheap plane ticket has its benefits and drawbacks.

First, increasing the price of sugar-based beverages. By rising the price, people will less likely to buy the product, since they it prompts a particular thought that people will waste their money. This radical solution has seen effective among Japanese citizens since their municipalities decide to culminate the price of sugar beverages in every restaurants and retailers by $2 until $5, eventually driving people to drink water instead. Second, subsidise a healthier drink option to substitute sugar-based drinks. For example, it can be seen in some Singapore streets where locals or tourists can easily find the fresh juice maker machine as part of the local government endeavours to reduce the percentage of people who suffer from diabetes due to their regular consumption of sugar-based drinks. From those solutions, it can be said that some firm actions by governments can effectively lower the proportion of people who consume sugar-based products. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the high number of sugar-based drink consumers is notably intrigued by the peak number of stressful events that currently happen across the world, as they begin to see that habit as one of effective coping strategies. To reduce that number; therefore, local municipalities can start to take actions such as increasing the price of sugary products and allocate more funds to a healthier beverage option in order to substitute the sugary products. <END_E> ",

Unemployment and corrupt government officials are the major causes of the significant rise in the crime ratio. It is necessary to make humans aware and make strict regulations for the rulers of the country to protect the economy. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most predominant extrapolation behind the excessive crime rate is unemployment in most nations. For instance, as per the reports of 2018, approximately 6.7% of the Indian population was living below the poverty line and this situation has been exacerbated in 2019, and 2020. If individuals are not able to earn enough for their living to fulfill their necessities due to the dearth of resources, they usually choose the wrong trajectory and end up becoming criminals. Hence, the lack of jobs is a primary reason that boosts criminal percentage. Another pivotal reason is the presence of some corrupt government leaders in the nation. There are some executives, who only care about money and they do not care for the well-being of their public, and they use black money to promote corrupt practices in the economy to maintain their power. Due to such cases, administration staff members who are already rich are earning well and the poor are suffering relentlessly and get involved in the line of criminals for their family needs.\r\n\r\nIt is enormously vital that an equal chance should be provided to all to get jobs so that the poor do not suffer due to money pressure from the richer sections of the society and this will help to control the rising crime rate to some extent. Public awareness plays a vital role in improving all the troubles in society, increasing crime rate is no exception. If the public knows about the corrupt government officials they can get together and raise their voices to change them, this will bring unity among the people along with this, it will be a huge step in eliminating the crime ratio. Hence, awareness and unity can work together to control this major issue in the countries.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the reasons along with the solutions mentioned above, it is clear that unemployment and government policies are contributing to an increase in the crime rate. Thus, the provided solutions can be applied to reduce this problem in the country. <END_E> ",

Do you think this is positive or negative development?\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'It is a common fact that being a professional athlete requires consistency in practising. As an effort to support their athletes, some countries build certain sports centers which are specialized only for professional athletes. In this situation I strongly believe that providing these facilities brings more benefits compared to the negatives.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several advantages of building facilities only for professional athletes to practice. Firstly, it gives more flexibility for the athletes to set their practice schedule since no other strangers will use the facilities. Subsequently, they can have more time to practice and improve their skills. In addition, the use of an exclusive building lets athletes focus more on their practice because their fans will have no access to the facilities.\r\n\r\nBeside the positives, using an exclusive building also has some drawbacks. One disadvantage is that coaches will not be able to meet new sportsman in the field. For example, non-professional players will not use the facilities to practice while coaches will spend most of their time in the building. Unfortunately, the possibility for them to meet during practice is reduced. Another drawback is that the government will spend more money on the asset. The expenses are not only used when they build it but also the maintenance of the facilities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the negatives such as giving less chance for new players and gaining more expense, building exclusively facilities for athletes is more important for the country. The importance is due to the development of the athletes' skills as their practice schedule and focus will not be distracted. <END_E> ",

This is because most corporate jobs require teamwork skills as they have many workers, such collaboration skills help to be more productive. Additionally, leadership skills can be developed by playing team sports as it requires at least one leader in the team, which is also an essential qualification for  bigger companies. Therefore, some organizations encourage their staff to play team sports. For instance, in Mongolia, bigger corporations organize basketball competitions among their staff annually. As a result, their worker can improve their soft skills while enjoying their free time. \r\n\r\nSecondly, individual sports maintain mental health as people need to spend time with themselves, and push their boundaries while they are training. This is because spending  quality time is almost rare in this fast-growing society, therefore, some people take chances  to release their stress after heavy workloads. For instance, the number of swimmers is  growing  these days because they can spend time with themselves as most people devote their time to work. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my opinion, doing sport is essential, whether it is team or individual. People can choose  their own preferences, such as corporate workers prefer teamwork sports as it improves their leadership and collaboration skills.

In many countries,\r\n\r\n students are independent from their families, or their parents are not wealthy enough to afford their education.

This is because there is a greater concentration of cars and industry in a small area. Cities with both a large number of cars and a poor public transport system are often in a particularly bad situation as they suffer from high levels of noise and air pollution. Other cities, which have economies that rely on industry, have to deal with problems created by manufacturing.

Although various opinions stem from this trend, I believe that it is highly disadvantageous. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, individualism lets people feel challenged to integrate into society. To be specific, it often results in a lack of togetherness and increased selfishness. Thus, it makes individuals feel lonely. To illustrate, when people solely focus on their own tasks and situations, they are likely to excel in their fields: however, they lack a sense of belonging. Moreover, they do not know how to communicate with others, or how to solve group problems. Hence, only concentrating on their personal rewards or aims is dangerous as it is a driving force behind decreased communication skills and togetherness.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the nation should never neglect the value of collective interests as they are beneficial to mental health. It is undeniable that collective mindset brings a sense of belonging which is a key point of living a harmonized life with others. For example, we are living in a very socialised world with various people and thus, we need to learn how to communicate with each other. Having collective thinking helps to improve social skills and secure emotional stability.

Take Taiwan for example, people there tend to work more than 12 hours a day, along with fewer national holidays in comparison with Western countries, and it is undeniable that Taiwan\u2019s electric industry plays an indispensable role globally. This could be due to Taiwanese hard working characteristics. Additionally, economic stability and prosperity can also result from a long working time.

This trend has sparked contrasting opinions, with advocates and critics each representing valid arguments. This essay will analyze both perspectives and subsequently offer a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason for supporting the teenage as the best life and the prominent one is that this life is stress-free because, at this stage of life, peers do not have any tension on their minds for earning money or livelihood as their guardians are working for them to fulfill their necessities along with their desires. Furthermore, at this stage of life juveniles grow mentally as well as physically and these are the most precious days of their life-span. \r\n\r\nHowever, in adulthood, individuals get the freedom to make their own decisions for a better future. They do not get any pressure from their parents and are held liable for their actions. Moreover, if they are working and earning good, they do not need to get approval from anyone to buy items for them as they are financially independent. Hence, it is apparent why many people think the adult age is more happiest.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, young age is the happiest part of one's life cycle because it not only provides freedom to the person but also helps them to learn new chapters of life every day by meeting new people and this stage assists humans to innovate their minds as well by discovering new trajectory to make their business more lucrative. Ultimately, both age-stages have their merits, and the better approach aligns with the comfort level of the individual. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, as per the matrimonials mentioned above teenage is a relaxed age but with the least freedom, but a young age provides financial security along with the right to make decisions. Hence, each approach offers unique benefits, but adulthood is better as in my opinion. <END_E> ",

The usage of such substances has some reasons, such as becoming more beautiful or being famous and also consequences on the overall well-being and society,like the loss of natural beauty and health-related issues. This essay will discuss both the causes and effects of the trend.\r\n\r\nThe foremost cause of this issue is mostly considered a desire to be more appealing and attractive. To be more specific, some individuals accept whiter skin as a symbol of the ideal appearance, so it leads people to buy these creams. Furthermore, today most celebrities opt for using lighting products and participate in endorsement events after which it pulls the attention of the public. Consequently, the figure for the brightening cream usage is increasing day by day due to the promotion of the companies for getting more benefits.\r\n\r\nOne of the profound and possible consequences behind the problem is related to health concerns. Those who overuse such creams damage their natural appearance. In other words, it results in dermatologic diseases which sometimes make it impossible to return to the initial state of the skin. It has a detrimental impact not only on the skin  but also on overall well-being. To elaborate, if  skin cancer occurs, other diseases will be inevitable. So, all these factors are a danger to both society and the health of individuals.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, producing creams that lighten and whiten the skin for the sake of gaining more money by companies is a pervasive issue nowadays.

The first positive effect of this idea that is people can communicate with people with ease around the world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it will bring positive effects on globalization, certainly, improving educational development and employment opportunities in developing countries. Indeed, most people in poorer nations who have good skills are hesitated applying for jobs abroad due to a lack of English ability and many young adults  are interested in continuing their studies outside the country because they perceive that English is difficult. For instance, many college students in Indonesia have a dream of getting master's in a richer country; however, they change their minds by deciding to apply master's degree in Indonesia in order to IELTS requirement. Therefore,  making English as global English will give many benefits for people , especially in education and job prospects.\r\n\r\nConversely, although it offers many positive benefits, it has many adverse effects. Firstly, domestic cultures in many nations will be extinct potentially and the mother language will be vanished.

Why is this happening?\r\n\r\nDo you think this will have a positive or negative impact on society? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In digital era, the advancement of technology has led to the development of robots and artificial intelligence systems that are increasingly capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans. This trend is driven by various factors, including the desire for increased efficiency, cost reduction, and the potential to minimize human error. However, while the rise of robots in the workplace promises to revolutionize industries, it also raises significant questions about its impact on society.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary reasons behind the development of robots and AI in the workplace is the quest for efficiency. Machines can often perform repetitive tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, leading to increased productivity and reduced operational costs for businesses. For example, in manufacturing plants, robots can work around the clock without the need for breaks or rest, leading to higher output levels and decreased production time.\r\n\r\n Another reasons are that robots and AI have the potential to minimize human error, particularly in high-risk industries such as healthcare and transportation. By automating certain processes, these technologies can help prevent accidents and improve safety standards. In healthcare, for instance, AI-powered diagnostic systems can analyze medical images with greater accuracy than human professionals, leading to more precise diagnoses and better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the development of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges for society. While automation can increase efficiency and productivity, it also raises concerns about job displacement and inequality. To mitigate these challenges, it is essential to invest in education and training programs to prepare workers for the changing labor market and ensure that the benefits of automation are shared equitably across society. <END_E> ",

I think this innovation plays a crucial role in our daily life and have a positive effect on my study and  work in the future.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognised that robots and artificial intelligence help businesses to improve productivity and work performance. which is really vital for each company to gain more profit. Besides, this technology also limits  time and strength, which helps employees save  time to do  important other things.

Therefore, the invention of this technology brings various benefits to our life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to social impact, it is evident that the promotion of global innovation brings to us various positive changes. Firstly, artificial intelligence can increase the efficiency of work which helps employees handle  repetitive tasks across an organization so that the labourers can focus on creative solutions and complex problem-solving. Moreover, robots are very supportive in helping scientists solve some difficult mathematics so that they can get rid of physical limitations better than humans. As a result, robot existence in the workplace not only causes  time consumption but also reinforces scientific progress, which helps produce some global breakthroughs. For example, look at the BioC company which is known by the medical business in France. The scientists here only concentrate on experimenting with the data whereas the other tasks such as identifying a number of cells are completed by robotic factors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  robots and artificial intelligence have developed in the company.

In my individual's views, despite many great advances, artificial intelligence technologies are still very far from possessing an algorithm that is capable of replicating human emotions. The best artificial intelligence devices can do so far is to mimic basic facial expressions and to voice these concerns.  However, this is no different from displaying an error message when there is an obstruction in their pre-programmed workflow.

Firstly, male co-workers are more serious and this job needs a lot of flexibility with students. People tend to get low marks with their teacher being a male and vice versa.

In other words, people will avoid time and effort which is more likely to be consumed in their own countries. Therefore, they prefer to leave their places wishing for an easier life.\r\n\r\nHowever, this way of travelling witnessed numerous drawbacks. Firstly, transformed people will be always considered as non-loyal individuals as they leave their original homeland. In other words, despite the comfort of life, they will always experience  homesickness due to the distance from their loved ones and their neighbourhood. Secondly, it is difficult to integrate into a new culture and change your original behaviour and language. For example, people immigrating into China will take a long time to understand the lifestyle and sometimes it might be impossible and risky. \r\n\r\nBy way of conclusion, although there are several beneficial aspects regarding  immigration, it is not easy to leave your homeland and there are several problems you will be facing if you decide to take such a huge step. Therefore, governments must increase the awareness of both sides of their people and ease the services to save their population. <END_E> ",

I think this may pose a threat to their health and waste their time, although people can have opportunities to find useful methods. \r\n\r\nThese tests will lead to potential dangers to their bodies. Many people are allergic to something such as nuts, so when they try new medicines, they may be unaware that these goods may cause damage to their health. For instance, if a patient who is allergic to apples takes a medication containing nutritions which comes from apples, he/she will feel uncomfortable and even need an ambulance. In daily lives, their common doctor will prevent them from having these things because they are familiar with their patients. \r\n\r\nThis thing may also be responsible for a waste of time for people. Trying new treatments and obtaining the results can cost a lot of time but finally, they may find these treatments are useless. So they fail to cure themselves and lose their valuable time. There are lots of civilians trying times and times, however, they earn nothing and just waste their time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trying new things gives people chances to find the right methods. Human beings have magic bodies and nowadays nobody knows everything about our bodies. As a result, no one can make sure that they give the appropriate medicines and treatments to their consumers. So if the one keeps trying different ways, he/she may find what he/she wants at last--if the right method has been invented! \r\n\r\nTo sum up, trying different medicines and curations alloww people to be likely to find the ways that are suitable to themselves, but this will present a challenge to their bodies and just be a waste of time. <END_E> ",

That is to say, The more competitive they are and the more they want to do well, the better their skills will improve. For example, in high school in South Korea, students are graded on the scale of their studies, owing to this, children always compare their scale to peers and have a desire to grow than before. For this reason, they try to study harder.\r\n\r\n However, if everyone in society were eager to beat someone then collaboration, I believe it would have a harmful effect on both individuals and the nation. If they learn only competition throughout the entire study period, it means they don't learn how to interact, care, and cooperate with others, and it will have a negative impact on their social life as  adults. In addition to, they feel blue or have low self-esteem easily because of comparing to peers. For instance, young people feel like they are not good enough because they are always focusing on what others are doing better.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, it is certain people benefit from competing with others. Nevertheless, from my perspective, the negative consequences are too significant to disregard. Thus, it would be a good idea for the school to teach both competition and cooperation so that everyone could learn more balanced thoughts in life. <END_E> ",

Therefore some people firmly believe that having their own living places would be more advantageous than renting one. The causes of this tendency will be discussed and the benefits will be argued. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main reason why owning a home is vital for individuals is because it provides a sense of security and stability. Rental housing can frequently be unpredictable as landlords may raise rental prices and decide to sell property. For instance, a family rents an apartment for several years, in which a comfortable life has been established: children attend schools nearby and parents have installed friendly relations with local residents. However, the landlord unexpectedly bursts with the informing them to vacate the flat since he has decided to live there himself. Therefore, it is much better to have their own residential building due to the fact that homeowners control their houses and are not dependent on the whims of landlords. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it is a positive trend not only because gives a sense of permanence and belonging but it also can be a good investment. Over time estate becomes more expensive, which means that homeowners can potentially make a profit if they sell their homes later. As an illustration, during the housing boom in the early 2000s, the reality of many people who owned an apartment in attractive locations increased dramatically. Hence, having an own house has many advantages. \r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the economic stability and safety convince individuals to buy a house instead of renting it. Home ownership gives homeowners a sense of security and stability and can also be a good investment. It plays an integral role in citizens\u2019 lives. Moreover, owning a flat is a goal that many people around the world strive for, and it's worth it. <END_E> ",

I firmly believe that these skills are really necessary to stay in a good position in the workplace. In this essay, I will present my point of view. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason I support this phenomenon is that many companies find employees who have good communication skills. such people have a lot of self-confidence to communicate with recipients. For example, in sales and marketing jobs, employees must rely on their own strength to convince customers by advertising their products.After that, their profits will increase when the number of customers increases.Moreover, in multinational jobs, employees have to communicate with foreigners.In such cases, personal contact is more important. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnother reason I agree with this statement is that satisfactory behavior plays an important role in the workplace. In an expanded industry, people work in a team and they have a leader.If the manager and the employees treat each other badly, the project cannot be completed successfully. For example, in an IT-related job, one person cannot complete the entire project in the shortest possible time. Moreover, they solve it with the help of 12 or 14 employees. In this case, acceptable behavior can create good relationships and give energy.In addition, you can share the problem with others if the other person behaves very well. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n To sum up, nowadays people can't do anything well due to a lack of social skills. if people have skills such as communication skills and good behavior, as well as academic skills.they will succeed in their professional life <END_E> ",

I will discuss both the views in following paragraphs providing my opinion at the end.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand number of people think that the media should respect the privacy of celebrities and  not follow them to click on their photos wherever they go. Everyone holds a right to have privacy during their personal life movements and the same applies to superstars as well. For instance, when celebrities do not want to reveal  their life events they should be given privacy. Being constantly watched by sometime is sometimes very traumatic, which leads to  unwanted stress in life.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that their stardom is because of the media\u2019s attention by keeping them always in lime lite. Therefore many think that famous celebrities reach  that level with the support of the media and the love of fans, hence it is righteous to know about their every movement.

It can be rest, culture, or business because people can do all sometimes with their schedule. Therefore they do not want to change their schedule.

I strongly believe that we can prefer both according to our situation and I going to explain some specific reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, discipline is so important while doing the program because if you change your activity you can be late or lose your real program or job. For example,  some business person travel too much for their job. They join some activities which are interesting if they have time  that travel. Of course, they do not want to change their vacation activities because they go  there for specific reasons if they change their program maybe they can lose their real job. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people do not like going on holiday according to any program and love too much spontaneity. The reasons for that are first, it can be so exciting because you do not know what you can do. Second, it can be so fun for people to enjoy without the program. Third, you can meet different people whom you do not know. For instance, one of my friends went from  Gaziantep to Antalya. he went walking and hitchhicking for cars.

What is your opinion? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'There is a prevailing notion that temporary jobs offer greater flexibility and freedom compared to full-time employment, allowing individuals to allocate their time as they please. While it is true that temporary employment can yield a substantial income, I contend that the stability and security provided by full-time positions outweigh the benefits of temporary work.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, individuals engaged in temporary jobs enjoy the flexibility to balance work and personal life. However, the unpredictable nature of their earnings often renders saving money challenging, leaving them vulnerable in times of financial need. For instance, in emergencies such as unexpected medical expenses, having a stable income becomes indispensable. According to recent statistics, over 60% of individuals in temporary positions struggle to save money due to fluctuating incomes. In my country, securing loans for significant investments like real estate typically necessitates proof of stable employment and income.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, temporary employment can be advantageous for those adept at financial management and time allocation. Despite the fluctuating income, individuals must exercise prudence in budgeting and expenditure. Moreover, the surplus time available can be utilized for self-improvement endeavors, such as acquiring new skills or languages. While additional job opportunities may augment earnings, effective time management becomes paramount. Transitioning between jobs smoothly can also be challenging; however, with proper planning and foresight, individuals can mitigate these challenges.\r\n\r\nIn light of the aforementioned considerations, the conclusion becomes apparent. While temporary employment facilitates a favorable work-life balance and offers opportunities for personal development, it also entails inherent risks and uncertainties. Therefore, I advocate for full-time employment as it provides a dependable income foundation and greater financial security. <END_E> ",

This essay will first suggest that the biggest problem caused by this phenomenon is the current state of technology and then present advice to limit the overuse of electronic devices. the most feasible solution.\r\n\r\n     The foremost problem caused by the development of the technological age is electronic devices with addictive games. millions of people around the world spend too much time playing games when they are at home and most of those games take a lot of time to complete. The consequence is that it affects each person's lifestyle, making them feel lazier and want to stay home and play games instead of going out with some friends.

In an online game, this has increased the number of children or teenagers who want to stay at home and play games with friends but do not want to go out and play with them.\r\n\r\n     It's hard to deny that parental advice and action is the best solution currently. To explain, Parents should advise or manage their children to consider using electronic devices for entertainment, limit gaming to no more than three hours a day and convince them with some outdoor activity. For instance, Parents should regularly spend time with their children or take them on picnics or participate in other outdoor activities with them, especially team building games that help increase family relationships and stay away from children's electronic devices.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, spending too much time at home can have many negative effects on children or adolescents.

I think that this may cause damage to the sugar industry and cause people to live unhappy lives, although people can be healthier.\r\n\r\nThis idea can pose a threat to the sweet-food manufacturers because there will be fewer people buying their goods. As we all know, the higher the price of an item is ,the less customers buy it. So if we make sugary products more expensive, a lot of people will abandon them and buy other products to enjoy themselves and as a result, the sweet food industry will fail to sell their products and be endangered. For example, citizens may prefer to buy more fast food like chips to have fun instead of sugar drinks or foods. The damage to the sugar industry may also lead to the unemployment of workers. \r\n\r\nThe higher price may also be responsible for an unhappy life. It is evident that sweet foods and beverages are the favourite goods of many civilians and eating sugar is a good way to enable people to feel happiness. So when we raise the prices of sugary products, fewer people can afford them and they lose a method to satisfy themselves.

Thus, children waste a lot of time on this electronic entertainment. Is it a negative effect on children's mental abilities? To me, I agree with this point. I think watching TV and playing computer games are negative on children's mental abilities.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, watching TV and playing computer games cause children to reduce thinking. TV programs and computer games provide numerous images and sounds. Children do not have the opportunity to imagine and create their thinking. They lose the opportunity to think and grow up. It will affect children's mental abilities. By contrast, activities like reading or drawing develop many areas of the brain and help children to think and imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, children will decrease interaction with other people because of spending much time watching TV and playing computer games. When children spend a lot of time watching TV and playing computer games all day, they will not have time and the opportunity to play outdoors with other people. Physical activity also helps with brain development. Therefore, children should be discouraged from watching TV and playing computer games.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, our bodies and minds need to move and think. If we stop them moving, our bodies and minds will get worse.

As a result, the citizens of the society are not able to live their lives peacefully. The situation is complicated by the fact that people find it difficult to recognize criminals from normal persons in the city.

Personally, I partially agree with this appointment because there are some reasons why I think like that. I completely believe that investing money in public libraries by the government can be more beneficial, while it is crucial for also public transportation.\r\n\r\n  One of the most significant and major reasons why I think so is that  recent scientific research shows that approximately 78% of people claim that the government should spend their money which comes from taxes for improving library facilities because some people cannot afford to study at homes as they do not have any kind of resources to learn new information in their field. So, they need to go to public libraries, and find appropriate books or other types of sources to do some research. As for online research, nearly half of the young generations who come from poor families cannot pay a fee for the network. It is optimal that if the government spend taxes on libraries, this time more people may utilize this staff\u2019s amenities, including using technological appliances in order to search a relevant website.\r\n\r\n    However, using money on means of transportation can be an ideal way to supply people with a comfortable environment. A growing number of people believe that it is more prevalent to get more opportunities on public transport as their numbers are limited. For example, some people, including me argue that it is the better option for preventing crowded places which are caused by having more people than necessary.

It can be the better way, if poor people do not have to pay any money for consuming transport.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I believe that both aspects are important to make our life a brilliant and beautiful place to live.

This essay totally agrees with that statement because such initiatives instill important values and skills in students such as a sense of social responsibilities, empathy and compasion, and teamwork.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, unpaid community service in high school programs offers invaluable learning experiences. Engaging in activities such as working for charities, improving neighborhoods, or teaching sports to younger children not only fosters a sense of social responsibility but also cultivates empathy and compassion. Research indicates that, by actively participating in initiatives aimed at improving the well-being of their communities, high-school students can develop essential life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. If this is made mandatory, all students would participate in such activities and reap the benefit it offers.\r\n\r\nAnother compelling argument for mandatory community service in high school programmes is the positive impact it can have on bridging social divides and building stronger community bonds. Compulsory community service projects often bring together students from diverse backgrounds and cultures, encouraging interaction and understanding among peers who may not otherwise have the opportunity to collaborate. This can help break down stereotypes and promote social cohesion within the school and the wider community. For instance, when students work together towards a common goal, they can develop a shared sense of purpose and belonging, which can contribute to a more harmonious and inclusive society.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, making unpaid community service a required part of high school programmes offers numerous benefits in terms of personal development, fostering civic responsibility, and building stronger communities. <END_E> ",

In the upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss both prone and cones.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a number of reasons for doing the shopping on the Internet because it saves time as well as getting home delivery. To illustrate it, there are numerous online websites available on the internet  their people could purchase every item related to clothes, crockery, shoes etcetera. Moreover, when buying things  online they get home delivery service without any charges. In addition, the online applications provide extreme discounts on items which lure individuals to buy. For instance, one of my friends bought Nike brand shoes from the Air Jordan website at remarkable price compared to the showroom. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are various cons also noticed of online shopping instead of shopping at stores. Firstly, online shopping has some policy for return, replacement and refund which takes time such as 120 days or more. However, if people shop at the store they could get a refund, return, or replacement within a day or a week. They never need to follow any policy. Secondly, individuals never can try any item due to online shopping they have to  wait for delivery but offline shopping is vice versa. For example, many families prefer to go shopping in the stores because they never trust products of buffering shopping.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, online shopping has time-saving services but It's not trustworthy for people. <END_E> ",

In this essay, I plan to spot my perspectives and substantiate them with examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this phenomenon has a few disadvantages and the foremost among them is the decreased amount of care, attention, and time that a parent, staying at home, devotes to his child. Obviously, the shortage of parental love and care can cause self-doubt in a kid and, as a result, harm him. For example, I faced such a situation when I went to work 4 months after the birth of my first child and was forced to hire a nurse. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in many situations, it is highly challenging to do a standard living when only one parent works. Needless to say, two-income families have more money and, as a result, more financial stability that leads to prosperity and a comfortable atmosphere in the home. Additionally, in these conditions, there is always an opportunity to find solutions to properly manage children's activities such as numerous kindergartens where they could remain safe until the mother and father are in the office. Moreover, having a half-time job is also a possible scenario in which all family members can be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the mother's absence can be detrimental to her kid, I still believe that adding extra income to the family budget can help improve the lives of the offspring. <END_E> ",

Along with this fact, it is obvious that our bodies are adapted to the place that we leave.

As our ancestors in the past were doing the same, they couldn\u2019t transfer veggies or foods to another place, and even they couldn\u2019t save them for their future. So, they tried to find new products to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, in order to deliver food from the producer to the consumer, we unintentionally cause a lot of damage to nature. For instance, the amount of gasoline that must be burned, the waste that is produced, or the preservatives that are used will cause serious damage. Another drawback of it is that people can\u2019t access fresh foods. In the long run, not using healthy food will have dangerous consequences for the body. You may pay a lot for the product, but most of this cost will be due to the cost of shipping and packaging, not the quality of it.

However, Motivation does matter; therefore, in rare cases, it is up to the judge to decide the reason behind doing something illegal and evaluate the circumstances. To cite an example, A recent report published about murders in the Times of India says that 17 percent of the cases happen as an act of protection.

In the same way, The Indian penal court has too many cases; thus, reducing the time taken for each trial is significantly important.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, having fixed penalizing norms helps save time and leads the case to justice faster, Consequently reducing the time of the judicial system.

For example, in the big city, the latest and most sophisticated technologies would help children avoid  various diseases. At the same time, the advanced educational systems and resources would provide broadened knowledge and insights, which can help youngsters have a leading stage compared to the country's peers. What's more, the existence of vibrant entertainment can provide an impressive and delightful childhood duration. It is important to the mental health of adolescents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, keeping children away from the countryside would ensure safety. It is undeniable that lacking  monitors may have a potential impact on  crime. Furthermore,the limited safeguard methods are another dangerous factor that would jeopardise the life of any individual.For instance,once there are some arsons who commit a crime and fire a house, there are few emergency methods or tools to stamp it off. Thus, the children have no chance of living in a completely safe circumstance.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that it would be better to let children spend their childhood in a big city,not only for the more advanced technologies, but more importantly ,safety.In this case,governments and families should devote sufficient efforts to make it come true. <END_E> ",

Moreover, some parents argue that maths is not important, whereas some believe it is a fundamental part of education. Thus, this essay will discuss the cognitive impact of mathematics, while also considering the educational obligation that schools have to accommodate all types of learners. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers for various aspects of a child's cognitive development. For example, a study done at Harvard University found that mathematical concepts are found in everyday objects, and that the average person unknowingly uses mathematics about 80% a day when identifying objects or solving complex problems. Furthermore, mathematics is vital to advance technology and perform breakthrough inventions that can benefit the future. Thus, it is essential to acknowledge that maths plays a momentous role on someone's intellectual abilities and can be considered as a fundamental part of education. \r\n\r\nSecondly, all educational institutions have a moral standard to accommodate different students. To illustrate this, High School Sunrise do not include maths as part of their curriculum, because 65% of their students have a below average IQ. Given this, it is imperative that schools still enhance learning, even towards children who have intellectual disabilities. In addition to this, it is notable that mathematics is unimportant in cases like these, however, if a student has the cognitive skills to do maths, then it should be encouraged. Hence, maths is important in some cases, but there are exceptions where it is not important. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is my contention that schools should encourage mathematics where possible, but  keep in mind that not all students have the cognitive skills to master the subject.

This essay discusses why the benefits of this phenomenon, such as convenience and safety, surpass the drawbacks of individuals sometimes having technical difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe first merit of using bank applications instead of physical cash is that it is more convenient for people. This is because carrying just one piece of equipment instead of a bunch of cedules and coins is more practical for most people's lifestyles. For example, many individuals have stopped carrying physical money because they may need more than what they have on hand. Therefore, when people opt for paying apps they have more flexibility to spend the amount they need or want.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is safer to use phone apps instead of physical money. This is due to the security installed into these applications, in case they end up in the wrong hands, while cedules can be easily lost or stolen. For instance, new studies say that travellers who carry physical cash are eight times more susceptible to getting robbed. In comparison, people who only get their cellphones robbed often lose less money, due to apps' cryptography security.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also a downside to using mobile applications as the major payment method. This is the difficulty that individuals sometimes experience when no internet is available. Officers usually recommend travellers carry a bit of cash in case their mobile data runs out or their phones' batteries shut down. If this happens, people may find themselves in a different country without any monetary resources, which can cause serious issues and time wasted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main merits of using bank apps as a payment method such as the practicality and the security, outweigh the negative aspect of people sometimes having technical problems due to internet connection or running out of battery. Furthermore, these issues can be solved by looking for free wifi establishments and also, carrying portable charges in case needed. <END_E> ",

Their primary resources are easily accessible within our surroundings, eliminating the necessity for further exploration of those secluded, distant territories. Harnessing alternative materials is also advantageous, on account of their eco-friendly natures. Ample evidence has demonstrated that biodiesel emits less carbon dioxide in the air, resulting in healthier air for living creatures to breathe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, awareness is still an urgent necessity in our society that requires serious attention.

The vast majority of teenagers do not have any concerns about daily problems and the only issue in their life is how to plan for their plays where they can have an unforgivable time. In my point of view teenagers not only do not have concerns about big problems such as monetary problems or how to feed their family but also their families provide them with everything in terms of financially and mentally. For instance, a survey which was conducted in my area in 2015 showed that only 3% per cent of the young generation knew the meaning of anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people have this concept that living as a mature person in society could be the dream time of every person. Since some individuals are passionate about taking some responsibilities in their daily lives and can be known as a grown man or woman, this feeling will give them to be important. So, by having this feeling about life and work, people think being an adult is the best period of their life. However, when you have different tasks in your life, you are put under heavy pressure as well as financial problems.

Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of this <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, the income from tourism has become increasingly prominent. While some experts believe that tourism can benefit the economy of a country, others say that it alleviates small communities. Personally, I strongly advocate for the former view. Thus, this essay aims to explore the benefits and drawbacks that tourism has on countries. \r\n\r\nOne notable benefit of tourism is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of an economy. This trend is twofold; touristic attractions provide financial aid for the transportation and hospitality sectors of a country, which overall impacts the GDP of an economy. For instance, the city of Cape Town is the richest city in South Africa due to Table Mountain, which is a momentous destination that attracts individuals from around the world. Given this, restaurants, hotels, local craft shops and transportation systems have gained significantly from this phenomenon. Therefore, it is my opinion that tourism is an advantage for all countries. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are merits to this trend, it fails to support peaceful towns. To illustrate this, Margate Beach has become extremely popular, which resulted in local residents to relocate. Furthermore, towns that has become succumbed to tourism, often neglect the peacefulness that once resided in the town. With more tourists in the area, traffic congestions worsen and the area becomes overpopulated. Hence, while there are immensive benefits, tourism can also disturb the lives of locals.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it can cause a disturbance for some native communities, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If tourism continues to grow, then more economies might benefit. <END_E> ",

Some people think that music can be beneficial in gathering people together from different backgrounds. I totally agree with this point of view for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, music can help people to communicate easily with others who have different cultures. For example, music can be used by a person in small talk to introduce himself or herself. If someone listens to music that is popular around the globe, he or she can comment about it on social media and also can see others' comments. As a result, people from different areas can be friends by sharing their ideas about the same songs.\r\n\r\nThe second reason why I think so is that concerts can help bring people from various cultures into one area and help them to meet new friends. For instance, the young generation has a big interest in concerts from popular singers and they mainly go abroad for these concerts. If someone travels to another country to participate in concerts, he or she can meet local residents and  share his or her own culture and also learn the local traditions of the country. However, this can lead to cultural exchange and help people to hone their minds.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into account, in my opinion, music can help people to learn about different cultures as they can share their ideas by using social media tools and also taking part in concerts can be a good way for people to meet new friends and learn more things about their cultures and traditions. <END_E> ",

To what extent do you agree or disagree? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: orally and in written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people. <END_E> ",

Infrastructure development keeps pushing for demolishing and replacing old buildings, which is why the remaining old houses can be considered treasures of the community. This makes the residents of those buildings can\u2019t help to find out more about them, such as when they were built, who lived there, and why they look the way they do.\r\n\r\nThere are also people who delve into the past to ensure their safety. There are still many people who believe in superstitions like ghosts. Particularly in the old houses that withstand years of different generations of ownership. There is a possibility that suicide or murder happened all those years ago, and the current occupant is afraid the lingering souls will come for them and disturb their peaceful lives.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the best solutions for people to explore, is to reach out to the senior residents in their neighbourhood.

What is your opinion? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, selfishness has become increasingly prominent. Some argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the lack of caring for others, which alleviates kindness. It is my contention that kind-heartedness can improve mental health and promote adequate standards for future generations, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of mental well-being. For example, psychologist Edwin Charles mentions that the brain releases large amounts of dopamine when showing kindness, which in return stimulates one's brain to be happier. Moreover, almost 80% of suicides are caused by a lack of kindness. Thus, without even knowing it, being friendly to a stranger can decrease depression and trauma for them. Therefore, it is evident that pure actions might both improve someone's own mentality and others. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is essential to underscore the impact that modern actions could have on humans in the foreseeable future. To illustrate this, anthropologist Kathy Steward explains that 50% of an individual's  actions are influenced by their parents. Given this, the concatenation of moral values and standards that are being taught to today's children could be learned by their offspring, which continues the cycle of rudeness; unless it is stopped and replaced with kindness. Hence, humbleness can create a beter life for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is notable that kindness can increase mental health and promote the quality of life. It is my opinion that if kindness is disseminated throughout the globe, then the lives of all humans can benefit. <END_E> ",

To what extent do you think laws are required to make people recycle more of their waste? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In today's society, environmental sustainability has witnessed transformative innovation. With the rise of environmental awareness, the question of  whether waste recycling in households is sufficient has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts argue that governments should enact laws to regulate and encourage recycling. From my perspective, while laws may help improve recycling rates, they are not the sole solution to increasing recycling.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that legal mandates can effectively raise awareness and encourage compliance with recycling practices. When recycling is legally required, individuals are more likely to take it seriously and incorporate it into their daily routines. Moreover, enforcement mechanisms such as fines or penalties can incentivize compliance and deter individuals from neglecting their recycling responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on legislation to promote recycling overlooks the importance of education and public engagement. Laws can set the framework for recycling initiatives, but they may not address underlying issues such as lack of awareness or motivation. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines legal mandates with educational campaigns and community involvement is essential for long-term success in promoting recycling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, enforcing recycling laws may pose logistical challenges and strain resources, especially in regions with limited infrastructure or economic constraints. In such cases, alternative strategies such as incentivizing recycling through rewards or subsidies may be more effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while laws can be a valuable tool in promoting recycling, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes education, public engagement, and incentives. By adopting a multifaceted approach, governments can create a culture of sustainability and encourage responsible waste management practices among citizens. <END_E> ",

From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why leadership skill is a god-given talent is because a leader is the most important person in an organization or company due to their inborn qualities. This is because eminent leaders are the first people in the organization who can be under astounding pressure to work, and make decisions correctly and they have to have a long-sighted mindset to drive people successfully. Owing to this, if the parents are the leaders, unavoidably their children would become  leaders in the future thanks to inheritance and genetics. For example, as the Donald Trump president is a well-off businessman, the majority of his children are successful leaders in the incorporation of companies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that leadership skills can be developed in intensive practice without inborn qualities. The reason is that one also can become a perfect leader thanks to living in a sufficient environment because they will learn by trial and error and especially they have golden opportunities to practice frequently. Moreover, there are a lot of soft-skill courses  online from around the world about becoming a leader. For instance, current companies usually organize workshops about how to become a brilliant leader to enhance the soft skills of their employees.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why leadership skills can be a god-given talent, but in my opinion, it can be developed through hard-working practice and non-stop learning. <END_E> ",

There are many phases where a parent-child relationship changes and adulting is one of them. I believe that parents should allow their children to make their own decisions when they grow older. Furthermore, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we talk about childhood, kids are very much connected with their parents and we all have seen small kids who never leave their parents for a second. As time goes on, when they turn into a teenager, they try to maintain distance from their parents as kids are going through hormonal changes during that time. Finally, when children grow as  adults, they again come closer to their parents and try to connect with their parents in a limited way. For example, children will stay away from their parents when they are in grade 10 or 11 and as soon as they turn 24, they again will try to connect with their parents because by that time they have learned many things.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents should have limited involvement in their children's private life as they grow older. Parents should also change their roles from time to time. For example, when children were small the parents used to teach everything to their kids but when they grow older, they should understand their children's boundaries where they should allow them to make their own decisions and guide them whenever required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the role of the parents changes when their children grow older and to save their relationship, parents should allow their children to make their own decisions and guide them whenever it is necessary. <END_E> ",

In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which this view is correct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, humanity inevitably faces various difficulties on the daily and solutions are required to handle these situations. Usage of science is by far the most convenient way of solving these problems; moreover, by carrying out scientific experiments, scientists come to conclusions which lead to accessing data capable of improving day-to-day life. For instance, air pollution has become a great issue nowadays and scientists have taken measures to address this problem. As a result, engines capable of using sources of energy other than fossil fuels have been produced; having a significant effect on reducing the pollution of air and in turn the increase of the quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince the tranquillity of individuals is paramount, it is understandable that the ultimate goal of science would have to be related to their lives;however, other factors are also of high importance; most notably  nature and its species.

This matter should not be dismissed as nature is a vast source of data for reaching higher levels of knowledge and science should be used to handle this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as important as the improvement of daily life is, certain matters such as the safety of other living beings should not be overlooked, for they have a noticeable effect on the quality of life. <END_E> ",

What solution can you\r\n\r\nsuggest? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad attitude among students. it is my contention that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricter rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aims to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, whom they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate in online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events causes momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there is the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screen time, internet availability or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home causes poor manners at school. Yet I believe, if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school. <END_E> ",

Many key cities around the world are facing the challenge of dealing with a large number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to long congestion lines. By providing free transportation, with support from government agencies, citizens are more likely to choose public vehicles for their travel needs. A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits. While it can alleviate  traffic congestion and improve air quality, it also poses a threat to cause overcrowding issues. <END_E> ",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the trend ? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Contemporary times see vast numbers of firms shifting to online platforms to arrange meetings. Certain individuals advocate that integrating people on the internet is a beneficial tool, while others believe that it has an extreme drawback for personnel. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of meeting online and provide a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technological investments provide us with well-equipped opportunities, such as comfort and flexibility. A myriad of well-known companies around the world altered their laws about meetings because of the contribution of technology. In this way, although the squad is in a formal meeting to discuss the firm's goals, they are likely to feel relaxed through the computer. For instance, departments could focus properly on their tasks due to some platforms when the earth struggled with the Corona-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the office, several strict rules for individuals are regulated by companies. In other words, staff work under pressure in the domain, yet when they strive to overcome some duties, the squad could arrange a break time at home. For instance, personnel might go somewhere since there is no one observing their actions at home.\r\n\r\nHowever, arranging a meeting on the online platform has some major disadvantages, such as distractions and troubles with connection. Generally, over three individuals live in the same home around the world, so institutes may encounter a myriad of issues created by the environment at home. For instance, a person with offspring is likely to be distracted during the meeting. Consequently, they are unlikely to concentrate on their duties. However, companies ought to consider their procedures for meetings since they have remarkable drawbacks for employees.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, even though talking with crowds on the online platform seems like an essential method, it has an extremely negative impact on corps' focus and their comfort zones. <END_E> ",

Discuss both views and give your opinion. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'It is thought by some that  observation during sports is a method that a person can learn about teamwork and strategy, whereas the opponents of this notion take the view that people can learn such skills when they take part in sports. Although I agree that the former idea can be true in some cases, I would argue that the latter  can boost one's knowledge  about these skills. This essay will discuss both views.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some consider that watching sports plays a pivotal role in fostering many aspects of teamwork and strategy. By observing sports people can see what players are doing, and what actions and strategies they are using in order to win the competition. If someone decides to start sports, it may be a good method as in this approach they can learn more about such skills without being injured. Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way they can learn about how to be a part of a team. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy. <END_E> ",

I would like to discuss both sides in more detail before giving my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous play because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, a young girl had a serious accident when she was climbing because it was raining and the path got slippery, this led to a result of her death. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that the residents should be encouraged to do all sports and activities that they like because not only does it provide a diverse range of play, but it is also the best way for players to explore their abilities as well as their passion to find talented seeds in the sports world. Additionally, this helps to increase the player\u2019s experience. For instance, a person is not good at swimming but she or he may be good at climbing. Thus if they do not have an opportunity to try to climb, they will not discover that they are good at it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to know that dangerous sports should not be agreed to by the law because of their negative consequences, such as causing serious accidents and death but communities should have the freedom to do any play or activity because it motivates more people to join the sports to find talented people. <END_E> ",

Do you agree or disagree with this statement? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'It is often argued that traditional learning, presented by teachers, is not replaceable with other technology-driven approaches. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. \r\n\r\nSecondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly assume that common teaching methods will soon be replaced by various types of appealing, novell, and time and money-effective technological trends. <END_E> ",

So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. \r\n\r\nParents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children. The aim of raising children is to let them leave the nest and stay near them but not too close. \r\n\r\nThis could maintain trust and reciprocity in the relationship. Otherwise, if this is not respected, it can damage the contact between both of them.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, children await autonomy, emancipation and living on their own to be happy in life . If parents are too invasive, children become distant and the link could be broken . \r\n\r\nTo summarize, whilst parents have to give love and respect to their children to build a strong relationship, they also have to not be too invasive in order to keep a strong link between both of them. <END_E> ",

In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. <END_E> ",

In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations.

For example, reading the news, calling a friend or family member or doing simpler tasks such as relaxation. Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way.

Personally speaking, I believe that advertisements should not target children, as it is crucial to protect them from harmful marketing practices. \r\n\r\nCertainly, choosing to target children in marketing may not lead to direct profits for marketers because children do not have the ability to make independent purchasing decisions. Since they rely on their parents or guardians for buying products, the impact on sales may be limited. Moreover, Advertising aimed at children also puts pressure on parents to fulfil their children\u2019s expectations \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children offspring may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked. Fancy advertising techniques can lead to numerous unhealthy habits, such as excessive consumption of snacks or drinks, which can have long-term health issues. Companies and governments need to be careful and make sure ads are fair, especially for kids.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are different opinions on whether marketers should target children in advertisements, I believe that advertisements should be limited, especially when it comes to targeting children.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.\r\n\r\nOne pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nTo foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action.

This essay totally agrees with that statement because such initiatives instill important values and skills in students such as a sense of social responsibilities, empathy and compasion, and teamwork.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, unpaid community service in high school programs offers invaluable learning experiences. Engaging in activities such as working for charities, improving neighborhoods, or teaching sports to younger children not only fosters a sense of social responsibility but also cultivates empathy and compassion. Research indicates that, by actively participating in initiatives aimed at improving the well-being of their communities, high-school students can develop essential life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. If this is made mandatory, all students would participate in such activities and reap the benefit it offers.\r\n\r\nAnother compelling argument for mandatory community service in high school programmes is the positive impact it can have on bridging social divides and building stronger community bonds. Compulsory community service projects often bring together students from diverse backgrounds and cultures, encouraging interaction and understanding among peers who may not otherwise have the opportunity to collaborate. This can help break down stereotypes and promote social cohesion within the school and the wider community. For instance, when students work together towards a common goal, they can develop a shared sense of purpose and belonging, which can contribute to a more harmonious and inclusive society.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, making unpaid community service a required part of high school programmes offers numerous benefits in terms of personal development, fostering civic responsibility, and building stronger communities. <END_E> ",

I am convinced that families where the mother has a job have a number of benefits, and they outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I plan to spot my perspectives and substantiate them with examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this phenomenon has a few disadvantages and the foremost among them is the decreased amount of care, attention, and time that a parent, staying at home, devotes to his child. Obviously, the shortage of parental love and care can cause self-doubt in a kid and, as a result, harm him. For example, I faced such a situation when I went to work 4 months after the birth of my first child and was forced to hire a nurse. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in many situations, it is highly challenging to do a standard living when only one parent works. Needless to say, two-income families have more money and, as a result, more financial stability that leads to prosperity and a comfortable atmosphere in the home. Additionally, in these conditions, there is always an opportunity to find solutions to properly manage children's activities such as numerous kindergartens where they could remain safe until the mother and father are in the office. Moreover, having a half-time job is also a possible scenario in which all family members can be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the mother's absence can be detrimental to her kid, I still believe that adding extra income to the family budget can help improve the lives of the offspring. <END_E> ",

I strongly agree, and I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nEach region, based on its geographical area, can afford all their people's needs. Along with this fact, it is obvious that our bodies are adapted to the place that we leave. While we can attune our bodies to weather conditions, we can do the same in the absence of some food and use other products instead. As our ancestors in the past were doing the same, they couldn\u2019t transfer veggies or foods to another place, and even they couldn\u2019t save them for their future. So, they tried to find new products to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, in order to deliver food from the producer to the consumer, we unintentionally cause a lot of damage to nature. For instance, the amount of gasoline that must be burned, the waste that is produced, or the preservatives that are used will cause serious damage. Another drawback of it is that people can\u2019t access fresh foods. In the long run, not using healthy food will have dangerous consequences for the body. You may pay a lot for the product, but most of this cost will be due to the cost of shipping and packaging, not the quality of it. Hence, you will not have a nutritious product.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in today's modern world, we may expect borders to be removed and restrictions to be minimized, but important issues such as health and nature should not be ignored. <END_E> ",

Not having that money as payment would put him/her in a lower position in nowadays competitive academic world and even it can ruin the next stages of his professional life. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is that a money-based system would not let a big proportion of  society  be involved.

However, Motivation does matter; therefore, in rare cases, it is up to the judge to decide the reason behind doing something illegal and evaluate the circumstances. To cite an example, A recent report published about murders in the Times of India says that 17 percent of the cases happen as an act of protection. Therefore, In some cases, the final call must be evaluated by the judge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Having a decided law helps save court time. As per Hindustan Time Journal, the criminal cases filed in the high court take around 5 years in India. Thus, having a fixed law will help to reduce the argument time and lead the issue towards a conclusion. In the same way, The Indian penal court has too many cases; thus, reducing the time taken for each trial is significantly important.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, having fixed penalizing norms helps save time and leads the case to justice faster, Consequently reducing the time of the judicial system.

For example, in the big city, the latest and most sophisticated technologies would help children avoid  various diseases. At the same time, the advanced educational systems and resources would provide broadened knowledge and insights, which can help youngsters have a leading stage compared to the country's peers. What's more, the existence of vibrant entertainment can provide an impressive and delightful childhood duration. It is important to the mental health of adolescents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, keeping children away from the countryside would ensure safety. It is undeniable that lacking  monitors may have a potential impact on  crime. Furthermore,the limited safeguard methods are another dangerous factor that would jeopardise the life of any individual.For instance,once there are some arsons who commit a crime and fire a house, there are few emergency methods or tools to stamp it off. Thus, the children have no chance of living in a completely safe circumstance.\r\n\r\nWith all the points above,the conclusion can be made that it would be better to let children spend their childhood in a big city,not only for the more advanced technologies, but more importantly ,safety.In this case,governments and families should devote sufficient efforts to make it come true. <END_E> ",

For example,there are increased number of individuals who smoke a cigarette and even despite wanting to quit ,it is almost impossible because of the addiction.As a result,it can result in many health issues and even it can lead to  death   .\r\n\r\nIt is possible to deal with this problem with the help of some effective ways.Firstly,the government authorities should impose high taxes on unhealthy products.

While some parents think that teaching mathematics is unimportant, other parents believe that this subject is a fundamental part of education. This essay wil discuss both sides of this topic. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, the topic of mathematics in schools has become increasingly prominent. Moreover, some parents argue that maths is not important, whereas some believe it is a fundamental part of education. Thus, this essay will discuss the cognitive impact of mathematics, while also considering the educational obligation that schools have to accommodate all types of learners. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers for various aspects of a child's cognitive development. For example, a study done at Harvard University found that mathematical concepts are found in everyday objects, and that the average person unknowingly uses mathematics about 80% a day when identifying objects or solving complex problems. Furthermore, mathematics is vital to advance technology and perform breakthrough inventions that can benefit the future. Thus, it is essential to acknowledge that maths plays a momentous role on someone's intellectual abilities and can be considered as a fundamental part of education. \r\n\r\nSecondly, all educational institutions have a moral standard to accommodate different students. To illustrate this, High School Sunrise do not include maths as part of their curriculum, because 65% of their students have a below average IQ. Given this, it is imperative that schools still enhance learning, even towards children who have intellectual disabilities. In addition to this, it is notable that mathematics is unimportant in cases like these, however, if a student has the cognitive skills to do maths, then it should be encouraged. Hence, maths is important in some cases, but there are exceptions where it is not important. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is my contention that schools should encourage mathematics where possible, but  keep in mind that not all students have the cognitive skills to master the subject. If students are encouraged to develop according to their abilities, then a more balanced lifestyle might occur in the foreseeable future. <END_E> ",

This essay discusses why the benefits of this phenomenon, such as convenience and safety, surpass the drawbacks of individuals sometimes having technical difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe first merit of using bank applications instead of physical cash is that it is more convenient for people. This is because carrying just one piece of equipment instead of a bunch of cedules and coins is more practical for most people's lifestyles. For example, many individuals have stopped carrying physical money because they may need more than what they have on hand. Therefore, when people opt for paying apps they have more flexibility to spend the amount they need or want.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is safer to use phone apps instead of physical money. This is due to the security installed into these applications, in case they end up in the wrong hands, while cedules can be easily lost or stolen. For instance, new studies say that travellers who carry physical cash are eight times more susceptible to getting robbed. In comparison, people who only get their cellphones robbed often lose less money, due to apps' cryptography security.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also a downside to using mobile applications as the major payment method. This is the difficulty that individuals sometimes experience when no internet is available. Officers usually recommend travellers carry a bit of cash in case their mobile data runs out or their phones' batteries shut down. If this happens, people may find themselves in a different country without any monetary resources, which can cause serious issues and time wasted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main merits of using bank apps as a payment method such as the practicality and the security, outweigh the negative aspect of people sometimes having technical problems due to internet connection or running out of battery. Furthermore, these issues can be solved by looking for free wifi establishments and also, carrying portable charges in case needed. <END_E> ",

To illustrate this, the pass rate went up by 25% at High School Paramore after incorporating digital devices and computers throughout their lesson plans. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence can help accommodate a concatenation of learning styles, which a teacher cannot always do. Furthermore, educational apps and video games can stimulate intellectual abilities, thus improving learning. Therefore, it is evident that technology in the classroom has numerous benefits. \r\n\r\nAlthough this trend has merits; research indicated that technology can have a momentous impact on the way a person's brain develop. For example, research done at Bio Labs LA found that excessive interaction with computers can decrease brain function, which ultimately makes the brain lazy. Moreover, children should be educated to think and not just search for answers. Hence, it is imperative that learners not use apps like ChatGPT to do their homework, as this could alleviate cognitive functioning. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is essential to underscore that technology in the classroom can enhance learning, while it may decrease intellectual abilities if misused.

The widespread usage of fuel resources leads to a shortage of their availability. Nonetheless, I hold the view that employing other sustainable resources is more efficient due to their abundance of existence. Prime examples are; biodiesel, solar power and wind power. Their primary resources are easily accessible within our surroundings, eliminating the necessity for further exploration of those secluded, distant territories. Harnessing alternative materials is also advantageous, on account of their eco-friendly natures. Ample evidence has demonstrated that biodiesel emits less carbon dioxide in the air, resulting in healthier air for living creatures to breathe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, awareness is still an urgent necessity in our society that requires serious attention. Despite all of the benefits that substitute resources entail, numerous individuals are still reluctant to switch their fuel due to a lack of expertise in these renewable technologies, hence public campaigns are advisable to increase mass lore.

The vast majority of teenagers do not have any concerns about daily problems and the only issue in their life is how to plan for their plays where they can have an unforgivable time. In my point of view teenagers not only do not have concerns about big problems such as monetary problems or how to feed their family but also their families provide them with everything in terms of financially and mentally. For instance, a survey which was conducted in my area in 2015 showed that only 3% per cent of the young generation knew the meaning of anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people have this concept that living as a mature person in society could be the dream time of every person. Since some individuals are passionate about taking some responsibilities in their daily lives and can be known as a grown man or woman, this feeling will give them to be important. So, by having this feeling about life and work, people think being an adult is the best period of their life. However, when you have different tasks in your life, you are put under heavy pressure as well as financial problems. As a result, these huge concerns would create a situation where individuals could be treated by mental illness.

Thus, this essay aims to explore the benefits and drawbacks that tourism has on countries. \r\n\r\nOne notable benefit of tourism is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of an economy. This trend is twofold; touristic attractions provide financial aid for the transportation and hospitality sectors of a country, which overall impacts the GDP of an economy. For instance, the city of Cape Town is the richest city in South Africa due to Table Mountain, which is a momentous destination that attracts individuals from around the world. Given this, restaurants, hotels, local craft shops and transportation systems have gained significantly from this phenomenon. Therefore, it is my opinion that tourism is an advantage for all countries. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are merits to this trend, it fails to support peaceful towns. To illustrate this, Margate Beach has become extremely popular, which resulted in local residents to relocate. Furthermore, towns that has become succumbed to tourism, often neglect the peacefulness that once resided in the town. With more tourists in the area, traffic congestions worsen and the area becomes overpopulated. Hence, while there are immensive benefits, tourism can also disturb the lives of locals.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it can cause a disturbance for some native communities, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

As a result, people from different areas can be friends by sharing their ideas about the same songs.\r\n\r\nThe second reason why I think so is that concerts can help bring people from various cultures into one area and help them to meet new friends. For instance, the young generation has a big interest in concerts from popular singers and they mainly go abroad for these concerts. If someone travels to another country to participate in concerts, he or she can meet local residents and  share his or her own culture and also learn the local traditions of the country.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Communication is the standard method for two parties to exchange information. The methods are commonly applied in two forms: orally and in written form. Both styles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The prompt suggests that the spoken method is stronger than the written form. This essay will provide several statements to emphasise that suggestion.\r\n\r\nWriting involves conveying messages through the composition of words, symbols, or characters on a surface, typically paper or digital screens, as opposed to using verbal speech. Written communication typically includes scientific papers, the latest daily news, or advertisements. Some favourable aspects of the written medium are that it usually provides in-depth arguments supported by solid evidence, along with clarifications. In the case of advertisements, they often employ convincing persuasion about their products to draw attention from a mass audience, further enhanced by eye-catching paper design. Nevertheless, text-based communication has its limitations. The textual format is unable to display facial expressions, making it difficult to emotionally persuade the public.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to written format, verbal speech allows us to deliver messages combined with facial expressions as well as aligned body gestures. I hold the view that this method is particularly impactful because it possesses the ability to influence the listener on a psychological level. Engaging in direct, face-to-face communication allows for a more fluent and expansive exchange of information, free from the limitations of written medium, thus affording the speaker greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nUltimately, written communication commonly contains granular data, yet is hindered from eye-to-eye contact. On the contrary, delivering messages orally has a great ability to change the audience's mindset, making it more effective to influence people. <END_E> ",

In my opinion, they search for this for many reasons, maybe out of curiosity, or for their own safety. To help find answers, they should ask the elderly in the neighbourhoods. \r\n\r\nSome people done some research on stories of their homes simply for the sake of curiosity. Infrastructure development keeps pushing for demolishing and replacing old buildings, which is why the remaining old houses can be considered treasures of the community. This makes the residents of those buildings can\u2019t help to find out more about them, such as when they were built, who lived there, and why they look the way they do.\r\n\r\nThere are also people who delve into the past to ensure their safety. There are still many people who believe in superstitions like ghosts. Particularly in the old houses that withstand years of different generations of ownership. There is a possibility that suicide or murder happened all those years ago, and the current occupant is afraid the lingering souls will come for them and disturb their peaceful lives.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the best solutions for people to explore, is to reach out to the senior residents in their neighbourhood.

What is your opinion? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, selfishness has become increasingly prominent. Some argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the lack of caring for others, which alleviates kindness. It is my contention that kind-heartedness can improve mental health and promote adequate standards for future generations, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. \r\n\r\nFirstly, one paramount benefit is the unparalleled convenience it offers various aspects of mental well-being. For example, psychologist Edwin Charles mentions that the brain releases large amounts of dopamine when showing kindness, which in return stimulates one's brain to be happier. Moreover, almost 80% of suicides are caused by a lack of kindness. Thus, without even knowing it, being friendly to a stranger can decrease depression and trauma for them. Therefore, it is evident that pure actions might both improve someone's own mentality and others. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is essential to underscore the impact that modern actions could have on humans in the foreseeable future. To illustrate this, anthropologist Kathy Steward explains that 50% of an individual's  actions are influenced by their parents. Given this, the concatenation of moral values and standards that are being taught to today's children could be learned by their offspring, which continues the cycle of rudeness; unless it is stopped and replaced with kindness. Hence, humbleness can create a beter life for future generations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is notable that kindness can increase mental health and promote the quality of life. It is my opinion that if kindness is disseminated throughout the globe, then the lives of all humans can benefit. <END_E> ",

To what extent do you think laws are required to make people recycle more of their waste? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In today's society, environmental sustainability has witnessed transformative innovation. With the rise of environmental awareness, the question of  whether waste recycling in households is sufficient has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts argue that governments should enact laws to regulate and encourage recycling. From my perspective, while laws may help improve recycling rates, they are not the sole solution to increasing recycling.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that legal mandates can effectively raise awareness and encourage compliance with recycling practices. When recycling is legally required, individuals are more likely to take it seriously and incorporate it into their daily routines. Moreover, enforcement mechanisms such as fines or penalties can incentivize compliance and deter individuals from neglecting their recycling responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying solely on legislation to promote recycling overlooks the importance of education and public engagement. Laws can set the framework for recycling initiatives, but they may not address underlying issues such as lack of awareness or motivation. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines legal mandates with educational campaigns and community involvement is essential for long-term success in promoting recycling.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, enforcing recycling laws may pose logistical challenges and strain resources, especially in regions with limited infrastructure or economic constraints. In such cases, alternative strategies such as incentivizing recycling through rewards or subsidies may be more effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while laws can be a valuable tool in promoting recycling, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes education, public engagement, and incentives. By adopting a multifaceted approach, governments can create a culture of sustainability and encourage responsible waste management practices among citizens. <END_E> ",

From my point of view, both of the given arguments have their merits but I would lean toward the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one appealing reason why leadership skill is a god-given talent is because a leader is the most important person in an organization or company due to their inborn qualities. This is because eminent leaders are the first people in the organization who can be under astounding pressure to work, and make decisions correctly and they have to have a long-sighted mindset to drive people successfully. Owing to this, if the parents are the leaders, unavoidably their children would become  leaders in the future thanks to inheritance and genetics. For example, as the Donald Trump president is a well-off businessman, the majority of his children are successful leaders in the incorporation of companies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people claim that leadership skills can be developed in intensive practice without inborn qualities. The reason is that one also can become a perfect leader thanks to living in a sufficient environment because they will learn by trial and error and especially they have golden opportunities to practice frequently. Moreover, there are a lot of soft-skill courses  online from around the world about becoming a leader. For instance, current companies usually organize workshops about how to become a brilliant leader to enhance the soft skills of their employees.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why leadership skills can be a god-given talent, but in my opinion, it can be developed through hard-working practice and non-stop learning. <END_E> ",

There are many phases where a parent-child relationship changes and adulting is one of them. I believe that parents should allow their children to make their own decisions when they grow older. Furthermore, this essay will provide examples and a conclusion to support my view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we talk about childhood, kids are very much connected with their parents and we all have seen small kids who never leave their parents for a second. As time goes on, when they turn into a teenager, they try to maintain distance from their parents as kids are going through hormonal changes during that time. Finally, when children grow as  adults, they again come closer to their parents and try to connect with their parents in a limited way. For example, children will stay away from their parents when they are in grade 10 or 11 and as soon as they turn 24, they again will try to connect with their parents because by that time they have learned many things.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents should have limited involvement in their children's private life as they grow older. Parents should also change their roles from time to time. For example, when children were small the parents used to teach everything to their kids but when they grow older, they should understand their children's boundaries where they should allow them to make their own decisions and guide them whenever required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the role of the parents changes when their children grow older and to save their relationship, parents should allow their children to make their own decisions and guide them whenever it is necessary. <END_E> ",

In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which this view is correct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, humanity inevitably faces various difficulties on the daily and solutions are required to handle these situations. Usage of science is by far the most convenient way of solving these problems; moreover, by carrying out scientific experiments, scientists come to conclusions which lead to accessing data capable of improving day-to-day life. For instance, air pollution has become a great issue nowadays and scientists have taken measures to address this problem. As a result, engines capable of using sources of energy other than fossil fuels have been produced; having a significant effect on reducing the pollution of air and in turn the increase of the quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince the tranquillity of individuals is paramount, it is understandable that the ultimate goal of science would have to be related to their lives;however, other factors are also of high importance; most notably  nature and its species. One particular problem that catches the attention is the extinction of different animal groups leading to the decrease of biodiversity. This matter should not be dismissed as nature is a vast source of data for reaching higher levels of knowledge and science should be used to handle this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as important as the improvement of daily life is, certain matters such as the safety of other living beings should not be overlooked, for they have a noticeable effect on the quality of life. <END_E> ",

What solution can you\r\n\r\nsuggest? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary society, there has been a global shift in the educational sector, notably marked by a significant increase in bad attitude among students. it is my contention that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to a lack of household discipline and parents have a duty to incorporate stricter rules to mitigate this trend.  Therefore, this essay aims to explain the cause, whereafter a solution will be given. \r\n\r\nThe main problem of this exodus is that poor manners are tolerated at home. To illustrate this, a study done at Home Affairs found that 75% of parents consider their children to be adults, whom they have no rules. Given this, most children have the freedom to participate in online activities, be on their smart devices, and stay out as late as they want. Therefore, the concatenation of these events causes momentous problems for teachers, because students expect the same freedom that they have at home. Thus, due to no parental control, learners are refusing to show any respect for their educators.  \r\n\r\nThough such problems have been going on for quite some time, there is the solution of incorporating better standards at home. For example, in the magazine Parents United, an article mentioned that guardians should teach their children to be responsible and humble by introducing them to a rewarding system. Additionally, good behaviour can rather be rewarded with screen time, internet availability or video games, hereby a child might learn more moral values. Hence, establishing different parental styles might prove to solve bad behaviour in schools. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that a lack of discipline at home causes poor manners at school. Yet I believe, if parents instil better standards at home, then it may well become possible to offer some better behaviour at school. <END_E> ",

Some motivation, some effort, and some dreaming are all that people need to succeed. Learning is easier in the pre-middle years. if someone starts a career.

The debate over whether cities should make public transportation free of charge in metropolises has been longstanding,with a majority of people praising the benefits that it will bring to the cities. It is my contention that while benefits such as less traffic and improved air quality will be fulfilled afterwards, I would say the drawbacks are solely limited to the accumulation of crowding in alternative transportation vehicles due to the growth. \r\n\r\nMaking city transportation costless indeed has several advantages, and one of the most noticeable ones is alleviating congestion in capital cities. Many key cities around the world are facing the challenge of dealing with a large number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to long congestion lines. By providing free transportation, with support from government agencies, citizens are more likely to choose public vehicles for their travel needs. A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits.

Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way they can learn about how to be a part of a team. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy. <END_E> ",

I would like to discuss both sides in more detail before giving my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous play because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, a young girl had a serious accident when she was climbing because it was raining and the path got slippery, this led to a result of her death. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that the residents should be encouraged to do all sports and activities that they like because not only does it provide a diverse range of play, but it is also the best way for players to explore their abilities as well as their passion to find talented seeds in the sports world. Additionally, this helps to increase the player\u2019s experience. For instance, a person is not good at swimming but she or he may be good at climbing. Thus if they do not have an opportunity to try to climb, they will not discover that they are good at it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to know that dangerous sports should not be agreed to by the law because of their negative consequences, such as causing serious accidents and death but communities should have the freedom to do any play or activity because it motivates more people to join the sports to find talented people. <END_E> ",

I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. \r\n\r\nSecondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly assume that common teaching methods will soon be replaced by various types of appealing, novell, and time and money-effective technological trends. <END_E> ",

So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. \r\n\r\nParents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children.

In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. <END_E> ",

In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations.

Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way.

They inform us about products and services, and can shape our preferences. However, they also can influence vulnerable groups like kids. In light of that, It is the reason why it caused some people to think that it is best to avoid targeting children in advertisements. Personally speaking, I believe that advertisements should not target children, as it is crucial to protect them from harmful marketing practices. \r\n\r\nCertainly, choosing to target children in marketing may not lead to direct profits for marketers because children do not have the ability to make independent purchasing decisions. Since they rely on their parents or guardians for buying products, the impact on sales may be limited. Moreover, Advertising aimed at children also puts pressure on parents to fulfil their children\u2019s expectations \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children offspring may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked. Fancy advertising techniques can lead to numerous unhealthy habits, such as excessive consumption of snacks or drinks, which can have long-term health issues. Companies and governments need to be careful and make sure ads are fair, especially for kids.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are different opinions on whether marketers should target children in advertisements, I believe that advertisements should be limited, especially when it comes to targeting children.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.\r\n\r\nOne pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nTo foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action. By addressing the pervasive influence of technology, promoting outdoor experiential learning in educational settings, and fostering community-based initiatives, it is conceivable to rekindle young individuals' affinity with nature. Ultimately, bridging the gap between young people and the natural environment is imperative for fostering a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the world around us. <END_E> ",

Do you agree or disagree? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary times, one school of thought holds that the advantage of technology plays a more vital role in the decreasing crime rate than in the past. While I accept that perception is somewhat justified, I believe that there are other factors that equally contribute to this tendency.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why high technology could be used to prevent and solve. First and foremost, the invention of digital devices could solve criminal investigations. In fact, by using modern equipment,  police officers can collect important information such as fingerprints, ADN, and other clues, which could help them to unveil those sins. Furthermore, digital innovations could improve the security of neighbourhoods. This is because, safety devices such as cameras, thief warnings, and smart doors, could allow users to access and observe their houses via their phones by distance, besides that these gadgets could act as a barrier to thieves, burglars, or robbers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that various elements result in an elimination of the crime rate. One rationale is the development of  education. Because of this, numerous students and the young might grow into valuable and decent citizens, thus, they are likely to abide by rules and regulations. Another justification is that the efficient management of governing bodies could protect citizens from offenders. To be more specific, an increasingly strict punishment as well as the quality of police officers means fewer criminal intentions, thereby creating a deterrent for lawbreakers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that technology applications could be in the way of the crime rate, I would contend that other driving factors could have a more significant impact on this trend. <END_E> ",

Although I understand why some advocate the aforementioned view, I assert that keeping wildlife in cages can offer advantages to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nSome argue that zoological gardens are improper places to adopt wild species. One possible explanation for this belief is that the adversaries may think wildlife is not well-treated when kept in cages for public display. Indeed, visitors are inclined to provoke the animals unethically, such as interrupting wild species' sleep quality and duration, hence reducing their well-being. Another factor reinforcing the perspective above is that living in secure and artificial environments can erode wildlife's natural instincts. Captive animals are given diverse nutrients by zookeepers according to a scheduled time. At first glance, this can be beneficial to them. Nevertheless, this positivity can affect their predatory behaviour \u202f in the long term, diminishing their ability to track and then hunt prey when they return to nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, I maintain the view that preserving wildlife in enclosures is not a moral action. The first highlight is that creatures in captivity have longer lifespans than natural ones. Nowadays, these species are conserved around the clock from illegal hunting by strict protection systems in zoos, helping them avoid the brink of mass extinction. Moreover, the owners of these establishments can collaborate with veterinarians to give them routine vaccinations and physical exams to keep them healthy and prevent diseases, hence increasing their lives. The second idea of this argument is that these non-natural environments can become educational destinations for people who want to gain more knowledge about creatures in nature. Visitors can observe their behaviours, learn about their habitats, and then raise awareness that wild creatures also need to receive the respect they deserve. In addition, by paying entrance fees, these people are contributing financially to the economics of zoological gardens to foster the animals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, zoos are not harmful places for wild species, and I agree with this. <END_E> ",

They argue that students spend the majority of their time in a day at school, and thus, teachers should be the ones who are responsible for teaching students about ethics. Besides, an increase in adolescent criminals in recent years has made the role of teachers in preventing young students from going astray has become even greater than ever. For instance, if students are fully aware of the detrimental effects of drug addiction, they will be less likely to experiment with drugs. Moreover, instilling moral values will enrich students\u2019 lives as they will find it really rewarding to aid people in need and are more likely to engage in voluntary as well as charitable activities such as providing food and clothes to the poor or giving textbooks to underprivileged children. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people assert that the function of teachers should be only about teaching students academic knowledge. They believe that showing children how to behave is the role of parents as they understand their children more than teachers. Furthermore, in today\u2019s job market, it is undoubted that knowledge is paramount to career success since most jobs require a high level of knowledge and expertise from employees. Hence, focusing on academic subjects will increase students' employability in the future and alleviate unemployment, contributing to a country\u2019s prosperity as well as societal security as people who have lucrative jobs are less inclined to commit crimes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a balanced focus on both academic subjects and moral values is imperative for a comprehensive education.

Thus, kids could become more introverted and, eventually, can be filled with a strong fear of being killed by their mates or random strangers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the mentioned painters could spoil the appearance of buildings. The source of this arises from their desire to use as canvas the walls of well-known malls or houses to share their work of art with more people with ease.

Commonly, many people who commute get stuck in it every day for hours. I, therefore, attempt to outline some possible solutions for this.\r\n\r\nImproving the quality of roads might help to alleviate the traffic congestion. By repairing the roads where they are damaged, the speed of traffic would be increased. Also, using more efficient lights at crossroads and proper speed bumps could prevent future accidents, which are one of the main reasons causing gridlock. In addition, increasing the number of paths available for citizens or widening them might be a significant solution. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the government can impose a charge on drivers entering crowded areas during rush hour. This would be highly beneficial because many people who are not in a hurry or shouldn't be necessarily in these areas may choose another path. Plus, charging drivers will raise money for the governments that can be used to improve the roads and build bridges and by-paths. For example, in Tehran, drivers who enter the traffic area should pay a fine, and this is spent on the improvement of roads and the growth of urbanization.\r\n\r\nFinally, governments can improve the quality of public transportation so that more individuals may be encouraged to avoid private cars. Making public transportation more convenient and decreasing their delays, with precise timetabling, will attract more citizens to use them. Moreover, increasing the subway and bus station networks would enhance accessibility to different zones of the city. As a result, those dwellers who see themselves as responsible for resolving the problems of their fellow citizens and similarly reducing environmental issues will cooperate with the government, making their city more prosperous and thriving.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, considering gridlock a significant difficulty for society members in metropolises, steps could be taken by both governments and individuals to lessen the problem. <END_E> ",

This is especially so if population growth and the number of unemployed people place a serious burden on land and housing that only high-rise buildings, such as skyscrapers, can handle. As a result, more and more people own their accommodation and have an official occupation, whilst constructing more similar superstructures in the urbanizational era. Take China as a pertinent example, where most architectural styles are homogenized by state-of-the-art methods from foreign nations during the globalization period for working purposes and housing zones.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this phenomenon is detrimental to the variety of national cultures. Although some people agree with the erection of high-rise architecture, the majority of citizens desire to maintain a tradition that is distinctive from another community. If all of the infrastructures were identical to each other between nations, the culture would lack enhancement and richness, causing the disappearance shortly without any solutions to preservation. Vietnamese houses are prime examples, where the plenty of thatched cottages in the past do not exist anymore because of no conservation and made way for the fashionable and large building structures in the urban and willing to enlarge in the rural designated areas.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the circumstance of modern society improved by the innovative architectural building stems from international collaboration with the aim of dealing with the global populous problems.

I agree with 2 different statements equally.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a number of training and rehabilitation programs should be offered to the majority of offenders, because they may contribute positively to the country's economy in the future if inmates take  advantage of these opportunities. For example, individuals who are provided with business and software education may broaden their horizons and increase their important skills such as communication and programming. Consequently, inmates will be able to work in different industries to meet basic needs and pay  taxes, and bills, which will be beneficial to the country's financial budget increasing overall revenues.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, long-term prison sentences pave the way for the public to feel a sense of safety and protection. To be specific, criminals are locked away and by keeping offenders off the street, they cannot commit a crime. For example, if there were no prisons, many dangerous consequences, such as re-offending, may happen in society. Furthermore, it is more effective when people are aware of exact punishments to avoid crimes, so the government has to put convicts behind bars.

Furthermore, youngsters are a fragile population that does not have, yet, the capacity to detect when they are in an abusive working environment.

What problems can this cause? How can these problems be resolved <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In recent times, visits to isolated and fragile ecosystems through eco-tourism have witnessed a surge in popularity in many countries. As a result, local communities and habitats are facing a wide range of problems. This essay will explore various issues related to eco-tourism and a number of potential solutions in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nBy analyzing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost issue related to green tourism is the disruption of the cultural heritage of native societies. By embracing a large number of tourists from different countries, a local group of people is getting influenced by international traditions, which is resulting in the destruction of their own culture and values. For instance, a native society of Kerala (India) has altered their style of cultural dance in order to attract more visitors. However, they are neglecting the fact that this initiative could result in the loss of their personal identity. Moreover, trips to delicate spots also affect the stability of biological diversity, which causes environmental degradation. By providing a large number of camping and hiking sites to travellers, the government is compromising the health of our ecosphere. More visitors result in more pollution, which leads to additional disturbance to flora and fauna species.\r\n\r\nBy seeing the problem with a brighter mind, a wide range of solutions is available. To mitigate this problem, higher authorities and the forest department should impose strict laws in order to preserve the native customs and biosphere. In addition to this, domestic groups should take appropriate steps to shed some light on awareness and the power of education among community groups to teach them not to be influenced by the colours of another country's traditions.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, eco-tourism has the potential to boost the country's economy, but issues in relation to this, such as cultural disruption and instability of the ecosystem cannot be neglected at any cost. By implementing firm rules and regulations, the concerns associated with cultural loss and environmental damage can be solved in the future. <END_E> ",

It is my contention that for children to be successful in their future life endeavours, both of these skills are equally important and should be amended into  classroom education. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I think every person was intrinsically born with a competitive drive inside them waiting to be harnessed by its host. Therefore, the role competitiveness plays in a child's life should be acknowledged by education providers so that classrooms can be arranged in a form that healthy rivalry is fostered. This is particularly a prudent commitment for  future generations to always push each other's limits to be better. For example,  constructive competition in a classroom can be utterly beneficial for the continuous development of juveniles. Consequently, all this boils down to the teachers who are primarily responsible for setting up and maintaining this system without undermining the quality of education.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the contemporary world, soft skills like teamwork and collaboration are extremely vital for adolescents in order to be  admirable leaders. With the help of these properties, children can learn how to be part of any society both in their professional and personal lives. Furthermore, excess competition is notorious for making people toxic and uncooperative, thus, resulting in failures. To exemplify this statement, schools should be organized in a way that every student participates in different science and sports competitions to hone their soft skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that competition and collaboration can be contrary to power holders in certain cases, schools should have a classroom environment where juveniles are able to practice  healthy competition while helping one another to overcome difficulties. <END_E> ",

This issue is a major concern for everybody on earth and we are all trying to be part of the solution. For example, in Europe, many countries are encouraging people to buy electric cars which pollute less the atmosphere, Or are telling them to lower the heat of their homes.  \r\n\r\nCruise ships, factories, planes and transport companies, however, are responsible for a large part of the annual pollution rate. Studies have shown that tour cruise ships emit more greenhouse gases than several thousands of cars. Therefore, I feel that politicians should make laws to manage the amount of these means of transportation, in order to reduce drastically the world's environmental damage. For instance, we could make quotas of planes able to fly each day, which could reduce CO2. Nevertheless, I understand that from an economic view, politicians are careful to make decisions in favour of the climate, as it could damage the world's economic balance. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, everybody should care about the environment and pollution.

First and foremost, climate change is the top urgent list of our world, this is always accompanied by rising oceans, strong storms, increasing drought, etc, leading to disasters. Take Australian bushfires as an example, climate change, can trigger extremely high temperatures and low rates of rainfall, which make forest fires take place more frequently, and threaten not only human living but also koala habitats and food. In addition, in terms of pollution, ocean pollution has incremental growth, putting a lot of creatures at risk. That is to say, to address the particular endangered animals issue, people should put more effort into other environmental crises, despite animal preservation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as more and more unique flora and fauna have become fewer or endangered, taking action to tackle it immediately is necessary or more of them will be extinct. Furthermore, extinction may have a ripple effect not only causing the other species to disappear but further accelerating biodiversity loss. While there is a ton of evidence that animal loss is harsh, I still think discovering and solving the essential environmental problems can aid both the earth and the creatures on it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the issues that the living on the earth encounter in a vicious circle, even though animal protection is vital, sparing no effort in radical difficulties such as climate change, pollution, and overpopulation can help more species survive. <END_E> ",

Analyzing these facts would give an extensive understanding of this subject matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the celebrity's perspective matters to the young folks, as they take to heart any idea this group of people offers. For example, I would have been a school dropout if not that I overheard Tiger Woods encourage a mass education campaign in Africa, moreover, he even offered to give scholarships to about 100 students. Clearly, this is a task only superstars are capable of achieving.

This interconnectedness has the potential to diminish prejudices and foster greater tolerance among diverse populations. For instance, individuals who migrate for education or employment find solace in familiar foods and customs, reducing feelings of alienation and homesickness.\r\n\r\nConversely, the relentless march of globalization threatens to undermine the rich tapestry of cultural diversity that defines societies across the globe. Local industries and traditions are increasingly overshadowed by global conglomerates and standardized consumer preferences, leading to the marginalization and extinction of indigenous practices.

For Example, During the COVID pandemic, all the schools are advised to manage t\r\n\r\nheir teaching methodologies  online which has received a huge fan base and cooperative results from the young achievers. Thus, involving them at the earliest age for digital learning would definitely make them dive into the academic curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe second main reason is that studying through these mediums not only improves their ability to search for unlimited sources but also improves their cognitive ability to face any challenges boldly. The reason behind this is, that by exploring the available sources, they are exposed to the new technological world where they can experience hands-on training which in turn increases their problem-solving skills. For Instance, Juniors who want to know about a specific topic don't really need to depend upon the teaching staff for their project or homework completion. Hence, it is  empirical evidence that these technological advancements are needed for the improvement of  children's mentality in a positive way.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that technological advancements in the teaching field are a much-needed concept and textbooks should be replaced because they cannot withstand the attractiveness and ease of accessing  data among students and it improves their broader thinking ability. <END_E> ",

Others believe that it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Some argue that pupils in further education have the freedom to only learn their major or learn about additional fields if they opt to do so. Others think it is more crucial to solely focus on qualifying. In this essay, I will discuss both views and suggest my own opinion. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, advocates of diverse education claim that it is highly beneficial to be exposed to numerous study sections as it assists in obtaining various job opportunities. To be specific, in recent years, companies tend to prefer employers with multiple skills. For example, employees would definitely give a chance of work experience to those who majored in more than two subjects rather than those who took a major in one subject, as they believe the former group will have more comprehensive educational sources and flexibility in the workforce. Hence, studying different subjects during university years is favourable. \r\n\r\nHowever, others believe that concentrating on their subjects is paramount for acquiring a qualification. Proponents of this thought claim that individuals who only study their department often find themselves excelling in their field as they can foster profound knowledge. As a result, good grades lead to better chances for a qualification and occupation. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while diversity in learning can widen people's perspectives, I believe that students should do their utmost to study for official achievement since more professions require a certificate of individual abilities. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are two perspectives on pupils' behaviour during their tertiary education. Although both views have merits, I contend that focusing on a practical outcome is essential. <END_E> ",

That is supposed to pose a threat to small stores and local communities. From my perspective, I am entirely convinced because of some reasons mentioned in this essay. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, they often offer lower prices compared to stores since they import goods in bulk. That is the main reason why many people prefer to shop in supermarkets to local shops. Moreover, there is a wide range of products so consumers can buy groceries, household items and electronics without visiting too many local shops which only sell some particular items. In addition, they bring convenience and accessibility. The reason is that they are set up in large premises and often equipped with ample parking spaces. As a result, their customers do not have to worry about finding a room to park their vehicles, especially in off-peaked times. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the possibility to approach local people, they have large budgets for advertising and marketing so their products are usually promoted on different channels such as TV, radio and online platforms. Hence, they attract more potential customers than traditional stores. Lastly, supermarket managers frequently run programmes for promotions and discounts, thanking loyal customers to get much attention from potential and existing customers, especially housewives. These aim to encourage them to purchase more for each shopping time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the supermarket establishment generally has threatened the operation and existence of small shops and local communities in neighbourhoods. <END_E> ",

I largely agree with those who prefer to work for themselves, but there are a number of arguments in favour of the opposite point of view. In this essay, I plan to explore both ideas and bring a few examples.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, owning a business is a privilege not available to everyone. To elaborate, a real businessman must have certain qualities, an analytical mind and management skills. For example, my father-in-law has described and due to them, he was able to launch his own shop chain in my country. Needless to say, owning a company gives the owner freedom of working hours and days, a sense of self-confidence and success, as well as the opportunity to have a fairly decent income. For example, the head of the company I currently work for has a well-known company in Canada and significant profits. Obviously, these facts make him a successful person.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being a full-time employee of a company means not worrying about financial plans and not thinking about the risks that accompany any business. Moreover, an employee has a stable salary, and, consequently, a stable living standard. If a person is satisfied with his income, he will be probably happy. If not, he has a chance to seek for more profitable job, which is easier than to reform a whole business.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although working in a company and earning a stable salary is more suitable for most people, still, having your own company provides more benefits to the owner, despite all the challenges and risks associated with it. <END_E> ",

However, others hold the view that there are more effective alternatives to deal with lawbreakers. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Some people claim that every lawbreaker should be imprisoned, while others believe that there are better ways to handle criminals. This essay will discuss both views and contend in favour of the latter. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, those who advocate for imprisonment argue that the stricter the punishment becomes, the less the crime occurs. To be specific, when lawbreakers are locked away from society, they are deprived of re-offending. For example, a notable study conducted by Korea University in 2011 revealed that countries with strong punishments like imprisonment were likely to have low crime rates. In addition, the experts concluded that the threat of serving a prison sentence may deter others from breaking the law. Moreover, jails provide an opportunity for rehabilitation as inmates can be educated through various programs and thus, easily reintegrate into society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others contend that alternatives like community service, probation, fines, or counselling can be more favourable ways to deal with felons. For instance, by undertaking community service, offenders can repay their debt to society and contribute positively to the public. This not only benefits those directly involved but also sends a message to society that there are consequences for legal actions. Furthermore, imprisoning all criminals is highly ineffective, as it is a waste of money. It is true that it requires a lot of budget and widened space to manage the accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I believe the best approach lies somewhere between.  Although serving a prison sentence can be a strong deterrent to committing a crime, other measures are still required as they alleviate the overcrowding problem in jail. Hence, it is beneficial as it allows resources to be focused on more serious and dangerous criminals. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some individuals say that all culprits should be sent to prison, others believe that it is not always the best solution. However, I think that a mitigated approach is crucial as every solution is advantageous. <END_E> ",

This essay discusses both sides of this argument and explains why I believe advertising is still important to business.\r\n\r\nA few think it is important to advertise products for good sales results. The first reason is that nowadays, people often follow at least a couple of influencers on social media. As a result, their followers will be more likely to purchase the item they are recommending, since they trust their opinion. For instance, my sister is keen on buying new skincare creams just because she has seen a celebrity talking about them on Instagram. Another reason, it can trigger the fear of missing out. According to recent psychological studies on humans, we are often scared of being left out because this can possibly threaten our well-being, whether physically or socially.\r\n\r\nHowever, others feel that advertising is not as effective as it used to be. This might be due to too much unrelevant content in the media. This is because anyone can pay a fee to have their business advertised on the internet. As a consequence, one's product can be lost in the middle of social media's ads frenzy and not perform as expected. Moreover, there are usually too many competitor companies. Therefore, it has become more challenging to stand out to possible clients since they might be already interested in a similar item from a cheaper brand. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe both sides of the argument have merits. However, overall, I think that the advantages of being advertised by social media influencers and the fear of missing out phenomenon outweigh the downsides of the crowded advertising vehicles and having too many similar brands in the market. Furthermore, in my opinion, business competition problems can be minimized by having a high-quality innovative product and excellent customer service. <END_E> ",

This essay discusses the merits and drawbacks of this phenomenon and explains why I believe that the advantages are greater.\r\n\r\nThere are two main benefits of taking a year's break from studies. The first of these is that people might have the opportunity to experience different careers. By doing so, they may discover a profession they want to pursue in the future. For instance, if I had known about an architect's daily routine, I would not have chosen architecture as my major. Furthermore, it will be possible to mature a bit before making an important step in life. This is due to having time to reflect on themselves and their personal relationships.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also drawbacks to this. The most significant is that it can be challenging to go back to studying after the momentum is gone. This is because some people might be already too engaged in work and in need of their salary. For example, I found it difficult to stop working from my full-time job to dedicate most of my time to college because I was financially unstable. In addition, another downside is family pressure. By not having attended university yet, it can be psychologically exhausting when familiars insist on asking repetitive questions related to future studies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe there are merits and drawbacks of a year break between secondary school and university. However, overall, I think the advantages of exploring different types of work and having time to personally grow outweigh the disadvantages of sometimes facing difficulties to stop working and possibly having issues with parents' demands. Moreover, I feel that family pressure could be minimized by both parties having a mature conversation about life expectations and plans for the future. <END_E> ",

This assumption derives from the lack of later appropriate punishments while having been a detrimental issue resulting in the emergence of other negative traits in a child\u2019s behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the dishonesty of young people, lacking adequate education in behaving is the most fundamental reason. To explain this, a large number of adults who assume responsibility for a child\u2019s development, such as parents and teachers, find it cruel to punish their sons after making a mistake including behaving dishonestly. As a result, they ignore these punishments or treat them slightly which often leads them will continue their faults, in other words, being dishonest more frequently. For instance, it is found that numerous Vietnamese students are dishonest with their tutors about homework by copying from the Internet and handing it in, for this reason, this affects adversely their study performance over time.\r\n\r\nConsequently, provided young individuals keep being dishonest, other negative personality traits may occur. As a sequence, these consist of laziness and overdependence on other people. In particular, pupils were dishonest in completing or did not take their homework seriously because they were too lazy   , then became over-reliant on other efficient gadgets, social platforms or artificial intelligence, for example, to finish. Therefore, this has an extremely concerning impact on teenagers\u2019 holistic development later on.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the strong agreement of the Z generation is more dishonest than the older is due to the lack of justifiable punishments for their dishonesty-related faults.

Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'The shift towards offering qualifications through distance learning via the Internet has become increasingly prevalent in universities and colleges. This trend presents both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, both sides will be explored before evaluating whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, online learning proves to be a great alternative although traditional universities are still widely considered as the best way to acquire knowledge and a diploma. Firstly, distance learning makes education more accessible to a broader range of individuals, including those who may have geographical, financial, or time constraints that prevent them from attending traditional classroom-based programs. This accessibility can democratize education and provide opportunities for lifelong learning. Secondly, this learning method offers flexibility in terms of scheduling and pace of learning. Students can access course materials and participate in discussions at their convenience, allowing them to balance their studies with work, family obligations, or other commitments. On top of that, online courses can be more cost-effective for both students and educational institutions. It eliminates the need for commuting and reduces expenses associated with campus facilities and infrastructure. Additionally, online courses may require fewer resources to develop and deliver compared to traditional classroom-based programs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this way of learning remotely without being in regular face-to-face contact with teachers in the classroom is negative from two aspects. First, online students cannot develop comprehensively like the way other students who attend classes at school do. During online courses, students can barely make friends or even compete with their peers. This is often linked to the fact that those learners seem to undervalue the significance of interaction and rivalry with classmates in an educational environment which, actually, are great stimuli for scholastic success. Second, online learning relies heavily on technology, which can present technical challenges such as unreliable internet connectivity, compatibility issues with devices, and learning platform glitches. These challenges can disrupt the learning experience and create frustration for students and instructors alike.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while distance learning can be a valuable supplement to traditional classroom-based education, it should not entirely replace face-to-face instruction. A blended approach that combines the benefits of both modalities, leveraging technology to enhance learning while preserving opportunities for interpersonal interaction and mentorship, may offer the most balanced and effective educational experience. Ultimately, the key lies in leveraging technology thoughtfully to complement and enrich the learning experience while addressing the inherent challenges of distance learning. <END_E> ",

Some emphasize the significance of diligence and persistence, whereas others attribute success to other factors like wealth and good looks. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, advocates of hard work and determination argue that success stems from personal development and self-improvement. By setting goals, working diligently, and persevering through challenges, individuals can achieve their desired outcomes. They believe that these qualities cultivate resilience, enabling individuals to bounce back from setbacks and failures. This is because they learn from their experiences, adapt to changing circumstances, and continue to strive for success despite obstacles. Furthermore, the journey of being hard-working and diligent fosters valuable character traits such as discipline, resilience, perseverance, and grit. These qualities are essential for long-term success and fulfilment in various aspects of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some believe that success is heavily influenced by factors such as wealth and appearance, as they provide access to resources, networks, and opportunities that can accelerate one's path to success. That is why individuals born into affluent families or possessing certain physical attributes may have inherent advantages in society. Moreover, money and appearance are often associated with societal status and prestige. To be more specific, people may judge success based on external markers such as material wealth, physical attractiveness, and social standing, rather than intrinsic qualities or achievements. For example, celebrities such as actresses and pop stars stand out due to the fact that they have appealing appearances, giving them opportunities to gain funding from companies and  build a reputation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although factors such as money and appearance may offer advantages in certain contexts, I firmly believe that success in life primarily comes from hard work and determination. While external elements may influence opportunities and perceptions, they do not guarantee sustained success or fulfilment. True success is rooted in the journey of self-discovery, continuous learning, and the relentless pursuit of one's passions and goals. <END_E> ",

This essay will argue that despite the fact that maintaining the status quo could save people from certain dangers, it is far more advantageous for human beings to go out and take risks because it is a necessary step to any success. \r\n\r\nNegatively, venturing into the unknown may expose individuals to unwanted threats. Things like extreme sports such as jumping and cave diving or hiking in the wilderness of Antarctica which need meticulous planning and preparation are not the games for ordinary people. For instance, every year there are serious injuries and fatalities reported when inexperienced mountain climbers try to make their way to the summit of Everest. However, while such incidents may hinder human bravery at first, I believe that daring actions are essential to achieve greater success.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA major benefit of taking risks is that it allows human beings to step out of the playground of mediocrity and push the boundaries of possibilities. This is to say that risk-takers usually view challenges as learning opportunities rather than a peril to stay away from and despite initial fear and uncertainties, it is quite rewarding to see their dedication bear fruit at the end. In fact, no historical figure has ever made a difference by playing it safe and being mediocre but they chose to take calculated risks. Take the founder of Ford as an example, he would have never invented the automobile if he had listened to the naysayers and refused to improve the engine from time to time until it became the renowned Ford cars we see today. Therefore, I am of the opinion that without trying new things, no greatness is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although ventures in personal and professional life can be dangerous to some extent, people should consider taking risks as a requisite for success.

I agree with the aforementioned statement because of reasons relating to a higher level of employment and enhanced cross-cultural communication skills.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this trend brings more job opportunities for local residents. Since international firms, which open their branches in different countries, require a high level of workforce, they will need to recruit more local employees to operate the business. As a result, the natives are offered a decent occupation with lucrative incomes to cover their living expenses and in some cases, spend more generously on their shopping. For example, Samsung, a renowned Korean technology corporation, has created a large number of jobs for Vietnamese since 2018, through cooperating with the local government to successfully tackle the high unemployment rate in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nSecondly, people have a chance to develop multicultural communication skills as globalization is promoted. On a personal level, it is now easy for workers to learn about foreign cultures and customs, enabling them to acquire more knowledge and insight into varying international practices. As they are exposed to cross-cultural diversity in their working environment and society, they  become more able to show  empathy and tolerate cultural differences. At the company level, globalization leads to a more diverse range of potential business partners and diversifies their investment portfolios, which contributes to their profit generation. Consequently, having global partnerships is essential for businesses to compete in the growing international market.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that globalization itself is a threat to local businesses. With the impact of globalization, more and more new products are becoming available in the market and people have choices. In other words, there is greater competition in the market. Thus, local trades, particularly small and medium businesses might not survive in the long run and this has negative consequences on the local economy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although I acknowledge the positive impacts of multinational companies and globalization, such as more jobs in local areas and better cross-cultural communication, the negative consequences on local business cannot be ignored. This requires implementing policies and regulations that promote sustainable development and support domestic enterprises while harnessing the opportunities presented by globalization. <END_E> ",

For instance, many people these days imitate the personalities of influential stars and post such videos and pictures on different online platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. If  this kind of  content is viewed by many, the owner is paid decent money.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, seeing that most countries have unstable economies and numerous youngsters  are unemployed. Copying famous one's characters is not a bad tendency as it helps citizens who are not employed to get a living. For instance, a study in Zimbabwe by Runga found that more than 45 per cent of youths who have no jobs depend on creating content online. Some of the youngsters interviewed said this helped them to stay away from drugs as it kept them busy. They also mentioned that the money they got motivated them to do more scripts. Thus, copying  someone is a good move as it helps in putting food on the table. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, certain individuals copy their idols seen on different social networks as a way of making funds for a living since most of them are not working.

It becomes more convenient for them to engage in their passions and hobbies outside of work without being accountable to extended family members. In a nuclear family, which is small by nature, responsibilities are divided and assigned, enabling family members to dedicate more time to pursuing their interests. Furthermore, when living independently, individuals do not have to concern themselves with the opinions or responsibilities of other family members. This provides them with additional time for reflection and self-improvement, which is crucial for personal growth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, economic stability plays a significant role in the decision to live in a small family or independently. It is notably easier to manage financial responsibilities when living alone or with a partner and only one child.

        "input": "<START_Q> Many animal species in the world are becoming extinct nowadays. Some people say that countries and individuals should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on the problems of human beings. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'It is true that these days, many wild animals are on the verge of extinction. Thus, many people argue that authorities and individuals should contribute to the conservation of these species. Meanwhile, there is also a widespread belief that priority should be given to human welfare. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the idea that countries and individuals should protect these animals from dying out is grounded in certain valid points. Firstly, endangered animals are often keystone species within ecosystems, playing critical roles in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Their extinction can lead to cascading effects throughout the ecosystem, ultimately impacting human well-being through disrupted ecosystem services. Secondly, many believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect  wildlife from extinction, especially due to the fact that human activity is a primary cause of the decline of many species. Animals have intrinsic value and a right to exist independent of their usefulness to humans. Additionally, preserving biodiversity ensures that future generations can appreciate the beauty and diversity of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that resources should be directed towards addressing pressing human needs, including poverty, hunger, and healthcare, rather than conservation efforts. In many parts of the world, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the human population faces severe challenges like poverty, famine, epidemics, and natural disasters, with citizens struggling to secure basic necessities amidst prolonged droughts and food shortages. If a government allocates a significant portion of its budget to animal conservation efforts at the expense of addressing pressing human needs, local communities may face devastating consequences, intensifying difficulties in making a living and sparking ethical debates about prioritizing wildlife over the immediate well-being of its people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is essential to address human needs and alleviate suffering, I believe that protecting endangered animals is not mutually exclusive to addressing human-centric issues. Both can and should be pursued simultaneously, as they are interconnected. Preserving biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the health and resilience of ecosystems, which ultimately support human well-being. Moreover, many conservation efforts can have positive economic impacts, contributing to sustainable development and poverty alleviation. <END_E> ",

        "input": "<START_Q> For centuries, important parts of education have remained, such as reading, writing and maths. With the advent of computers, some people think that computer skills be made us a fourth skill to be added to the list. To what extent do you agree? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'The traditional material of education including reading, writing and maths is being speculated to shift by many, with a growing regard for computer science as a necessary concept, a new idea in training students. In this essay, I will advocate this idea and explain my reasons in favour of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, computers have become a ubiquitous device that affects several sections of our lives. Without having essential knowledge of computer skills, we probably have a lot of troubles in our daily routines. Computers have also become an integral part of most  jobs. Accountants, teachers, and bank clerks are only a few of many examples of this reality.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  digital technology is replacing the other types of communication methods. The emergence of computers  gives many an opportunity to talk and see each other at the same time, a precious capability that makes an enormous contribution to saving our time and resources. For example,  meetings can be easily held with the attendants from different places of the world with just a few clicks.\r\n\r\nLast but not least,  computers have had a deep effect on the other sciences. With aid of the computers, many calculations in maths, and engineering can be done in the blink of an eye. In this respect, progress in these sciences can be accelerated considerably. For instance, constructing a massive building or skyscraper has been possible just because  the software does heavy arithmetic calculations.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, learning computer skills is a must for most  people. Teaching basic instructions in schools will enable the students to be more prolific and successful in their future social lives and careers. Computers can facilitate the process of communication and reduce the waste of  time and  money. The extraordinary potential of computing has made these intelligent devices a good aid in  the process of research and development. All in all, it seems that unless one doesn't know how to work with a computer, they will be considered illustrated. <END_E> ",

        "input": "<START_Q> Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians, or sports stars are paid too much money.\r\n\r\nDo you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nWhich other types of jobs should be highly paid? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'Some people think that the salaries of famous musicians, movie stars, and sports celebrities are too high. This essay discusses why I agree with the statement and which other careers should be paid more.\r\n\r\nI strongly agree that celebrities' salaries are too high. This is because their earnings are disproportionally higher than those of non-known artists. For instance, I am at the beginning of my artistic career and, very often, I find myself struggling to pay rent and other essential bills. Another reason why I think this statement is true is that most well-known entertainer often spends a lot of cash on luxury products. The reason for this might be that they are constantly trying to prove their social status by purchasing futile items, such as jewellery, cars, or mansions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other careers should earn more. The first of these are health-related positions, such as doctors, nurses, and dentists. This is because people's lives depend on this type of work and therefore, they should be paid accordingly. Another profession that should have a higher wage is educators, such as schoolteachers. The reason for this is that education is one of the most important pillars of a developed society. Consequently, educational workers' pay should be higher due to their responsibility to the country's teaching system.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my reasons to believe that celebrities are paid too much are that they receive a disproportional amount of cash in comparison to beginner artists and that they are often keen on spending their salaries on luxury items. The professions that should be paid a lot more than they usually do are health-related positions and educators. <END_E> ",

        "input": "<START_Q> In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasise that their products are new in some way. \r\n\r\nWhy is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'These days various companies are producing new advertisements regarding their brand-new goods that are not frequently seen compared to the past. To me, this is because, in today's world, new products are more eye-catching to notions than what they have previously seen, so they tend to buy them. Therefore, I believe that it is a negative development, due to a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, advertisements are going in a direction that depicts a brand that has produced an interesting new product that has not been seen before. This is because, individuals are becoming more interested in things that are somehow unique, which brings curiosity for them to try them. In this case, businesses are putting more effort into coming up with new ideas, to improve their trade and earn more money. For example, makeup brands are now producing brand-new makeup every day to get people's attention to try them out, and also this can not be done without proper advertising. Furthermore, they will spend a great amount of their money on advertisements to bring up the notions of curiosity.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, this statement holds various drawbacks, due to the fact that much more primary materials will be used for fulfilling society's needs. This situation will destroy the environment by providing raw materials that can be extremely harmful to nature, as this process requires extra effort and a great amount of energy will be wasted. On the other hand, this might cause wasting money on unnecessary products while the old ones work properly. This method, moreover, is a way to brainwash people into spending their bucks for company growth. On the contrary, the result of purchasing these products is consumerism which has significant disadvantages, as individuals might not be satisfied with their belongings and always try to reach for more.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I hold the belief that advertising to get society's attention to purchase a new product might be beneficial for the companies as it will bring undeniable damage to the economy and our minds, to pursue more than what is needed. <END_E> ",

I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThis essay will look at the benefits and drawbacks of this situation.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, the higher amount of adolescents can be an issue for the government, specifically in the case of the ability to pay. Moreover, young people apply for medical treatment much less often than elder people, which can negatively affect the turnover of the hospitals  and considerably decrease medical progress in the countries. To give an illustration, according to the statistics of the Eurasian National University, there is a piece of evidence that in most cases 50+ years old adults start to have medical check-ups and use other medical services.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the main advantages of a large number of youngsters can influence the economy's prosperity and a stronger workforce. Besides, young individuals have more abilities to work and bring benefits to the economy of the country.For instance, the average age of the population in Kazakhstan is around 30 years, which positively impacts the social development of the country. What is more, it is undeniable that each country takes into account the possibility of potential wars and organizes the appropriate preparation, therefore  young citizens are in demand of those kinds of situations. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can hardly be denied that there are negative sides to increasing  the young population but nevertheless, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for several reasons mentioned in the reason. <END_E> ",

        "input": "<START_Q> In many countries, traditional customs are being lost.\r\n\r\nWhy would this happen?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think school and parent should do to keep these custom alive? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'In contemporary times, many nations are undergoing the elimination of their own cultures. This essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind this phenomenon before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle it.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary reasons why local customs are disappearing in numerous territories. First and foremost, the development of international tourism could badly affect local communities. To be more specific, an increase in the number of tourists means higher demands for touring services such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation. As a result, individuals who work in craft villages are likely to switch their careers to pursue jobs involved in travelling fields, thereby leading to the extinction of traditional occupations and other unique handmade products. Furthermore, the evolution of the Internet and the digital era could harm regional citizens. This is because Western culture is becoming prevalent in social media, which could have an influence that encourages locals to change their lifestyles, such as clothes, the colour of their hair, or hobbies, as they try to imitate foreigners.\r\n\r\nTo protect the traditional customs against negative effects from alien cultures, the following essential steps should be taken. One remedy is that government bodies could pass some laws to maintain domestic occupations. For example, authorities could establish funding to improve craftsmen's salaries as well as introduce their special goods to the world, which could not only help the locals have better lives but also create a sustainable tourism industry. Another remedy is that the government could increase citizens' awareness about their values and histories. By providing more cultural lessons in schools or publishing magazines and news about historical sites or scenic spots as actions of conservation, thereby enhancing the country's imagination in the public eye as well as enriching individuals' patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative tendency, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to deal with this issue. <END_E> ",

Despite the fact that there are drawbacks to providing free university education, I believe that it brings about much more benefits. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are three main reasons  why governments should not offer free university education to citizens. Firstly, the budget could be used on other more important things such as healthcare and infrastructure to ensure a higher standard of living for citizens. Secondly, the rich can easily afford to pay for their college education, so it would be unnecessary for governments to support them. Finally, not all governments can afford to cover university education costs because there would be too much financial burden to bear. This is especially true in times of financial crisis like the subprime crisis in 2008 when budgets were cut severely.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are benefits to making university education accessible for all citizens. Free and quality higher education should be the basic right of every citizen since they pay taxes in one of the other ways to the government. This will also promote equality and reduce inequality among the rich and the poor where there is a widening income gap. By ensuring equal opportunities and an adequate living standard for all people, the crime rate will be much lower. Moreover, free university education would provide students with a fresh start since many young people in the US have a huge student loan debt.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of offering free university education for all citizens far outweigh the disadvantages. <END_E> ",

        "input": "<START_Q> Plastic shopping bags are used widely and cause many environmental problems. Some people say they should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree? <END_Q> \n <START_E> 'The question of whether the use of rubber bags, which are widely used across the globe for shopping, ought to be restricted, since it is not eco-friendly has sparked a substantial debate. While many advocate for this, which I firmly agree with, others argue against it. Analyzing these facts that it is non-biodegradable, as well as dangerous to aquatic life, would give a comprehensive overview of this subject matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, polyethene bags can neither decompose nor can they be recycled after use, so they are often trashed. For instance, the research report, from my recently completed capstone project on environmental analysis, shows that these bags are left to litter the streets since the dump sites are filled up and there is no other alternative means of disposal. Obviously, this can only be controlled if the production is stopped. Therefore, banning the use of plastic bags, in shopping centres is the only means of stopping this.\r\n\r\nSecondly, most marine life dies as a result of digesting these bags, which are often dumped into the oceans. For example, the frozen catfish I purchased a few days ago, has nylon twisted in the stomach which killed it. Clearly, most aquatic life would be saved if the use of polythene bags were banned completely. Thus, one of the reasons why Poly plastic bags should be banned.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the argument surrounding whether plastic bags used for shopping  should be banned  because they cause damage to the environment has prompted considerable dispute. Some champion this idea, which I completely support, whereas others contend against it. Examining the factuality that it is non-recyclable and dangerous to  marine species, has proved the need for total eradication of these bags by the authorities. <END_E> ",
